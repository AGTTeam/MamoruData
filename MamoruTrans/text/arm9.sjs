Roughly one thousand years ago@
There was an era of tremendous\nprosperity and great glory,\nbrought about by the power of the\nÅgMagiciteÅh, a stone created by\nhighly-developed alchemy.
The legendary civilization said\nto have been destroyed in a single\nnight@ Edenbar.
By absorbing the forces of nature,\nsuch as Åefire', Åewater', Åeearth' and\nÅeair', the ÅgMagiciteÅh that\nsustained the Edenbar civilization\nwas able to exert massive influence\nat will, a tainted power that\ntrespassed on God's domain.
The people, acting out of self-\ninterest, abused the power without\nany consideration of the effect\nthat it would have on the world.
As a result, the balance of the\nnatural world crumbled. Having gone\ntoo far, the civilisation was left\nwith no other path than to its ruin.
And, in the present day@
We've received all sorts of requests from the\nvillagers, traders and hunter's association.
Come back once you've completed a quest.
You aren't currently on any quests, so there's\nnothing to see here.
Oh? Leaving so soon?
You can't take on two requests at the same time.\nFinish your current quest first.
You can abandon your current quest, but note\nthat the contract fee you paid won't be returned.\n
This quest is to assess your abilities as a new\nhunter.\nPlease see it through to the end.
You can report that you've finished a request at\nthe reception desk.\nDrop by any time.

But even if it didn't come to hate humans, there's\nno way it'd be this friendly, right?\n\n
Mur??\nWhatcha muttering about, mur??\n\n
Er@\n(@Maybe I should still ask, just in case?)\n\n
Have you ever been to a village where humans live?\n\n\n
Where humans live@\n\n\n
@Mur been.\n\n\n
Really!?\n\n\n
@Are you gonna get mad with mur?\n@Are you gonna throw rocks at mur again?\n\n
@Throw rocks?\n\n\n
Long ago, mur went to a village full of humans\nbecause mur wanted to be friends with them.\n\n
And then, everyone started shouting and throwing\nrocks at mur.\n\n
Mur got scared and ran away, mur@\n\n\n
Did everyone get mad because mur went to a human\nplace?\n\n
@No, that's not it.\n\n\n
At that time, they were probably surprised that a\nmonster suddenly entered the village.\n\n
Some monsters are friendly like you, but there are\nstill a lot of them who attack humans.\n\n
So, when they saw you, I guess they misunderstood\nand thought you were going to attack.\n\n
Mur wouldn't do something like that, mur!\nMur just wanted to get along@\n\n
It's okay. There are some humans who want to get\nto know you too.\n\n
@When you were being driven away from village,\nthere was a woman there named <C03>Viola<C04>.\n\n
She wants to meet you and apologise.\nYou should go and make friends.\n\n
Really, mur?\nReally, really, mur?\n\n
Yeah. I was hired to pass along the message.\n\n\n
Well, now you know.\nGo, and be safe.\n\n
Mur!!\nMur going! Thank you, mur!\n\n
ÅÑRen quietly watched the Mumur, as it happily\nÅ@bounced away@\n\n
Oh, welcome.\n\n\n
ÅÑThe Adventurers Guild was crowded with\nÅ@Adventurers dreaming of finding treasure,\nÅ@the same as ever.\n
Did you hear?\nSomething terrible happened in the capital.\n\n
I don't know if that has anything to do with it,\nbut it seems that lately there have been a few\nearthquakes inside the ruins@\n
@Yeah, seems like it.\n\n\n
Wha- You already knew about it?\nActually, shouldn't you be going back there?\n\n
It's fine.\n@She's got this.\n\n
@?\n\n\n
Ah, speaking of@\nThis is for you.\n\n
It's@ a key?\n\n\n
An adventurer found it the ruins.\nApparently, it lets you travel even deeper into\nthe second layer@\n
They said it was filled with ridiculously strong\nmonsters, and unable to cope, gave it to the\nguild.\n
@You'll need it, won't you?\n\n\n
Yeah@ Thank you.\n\n\n
We're still receiving a lot of requests here too,\nso we'll be in trouble if you don't keep on taking\njobs.\n
But, don't overdo it, okay?\n\n\n
@Right.\n\n\n
I will return, like I promised I would.\n\n\n
This room is also rather big.\n\n\n
ÅÑRen restlessly surveyed the room, which was so\nÅ@large that it was impossible to see the ceiling\nÅ@above or the walls to either side.\nÅÑIt seemed that the floor to the left and right\nÅ@had been cut away, with what appeared to be a\nÅ@sheer drop surrounding the area.\nÅÑThere was no way to judge where the chasm\nÅ@shrouded in darkness might lead.\n\nÅÑOnly@ that the deep darkness seemed to warn\nÅ@of a deadly fall.\n\n
@The other rooms were bad enough, but this is\neven more creepy@\n\nStill, it's places like this where new discoveries lie.\n\n
@Hm? @I hear something.\n\n\n
ÅÑWas it because of the strange atmosphere that\nÅ@filled the room@? Or had the thought of\nÅ@treasure close at hand made him careless@?\nÅÑEither way@ Ren had failed to notice the\nÅ@presence of the creature drawing ever closer@\n\n
Rooooooaaar!!\n\n\n
A d@dragon!?\n\n\n
@Why have you come here?\n\n\n
@!?\n\n\n
ÅÑThe giant dragon that had appeared from the\nÅ@depths of the darkness simply stared at Ren@\n\nÅÑ@and asked a question with a low voice that\nÅ@was both quiet and intimidating.\n\n
@@@@\n\n\n
ÅÑRen didn't answer.\n\n\nÅÑNo@ To be precise, he couldn't answer.\n\n\nÅÑPerhaps overwhelmed by the sudden appearance\nÅ@of the dragon, he found himself unable to move\nÅ@a muscle.\n
Answer me. What business have you here?\n\n\n
@I'm investigating these ruins.\n\n\n
@A thief, then.\n\n\n
I am the <C03>Guardian<C04> of these ruins. I'm bound to\nthis place, burdened with the task of protecting\nit@\n@Are you so foolish as to not understand the\nmeaning of those words?\n\n
ÅÑThe quietly-speaking dragon's voice had shifted\nÅ@in tone.\n\nÅÑRen who had been listening in silence, noticed\nÅ@the change and returned to his senses.\n
@That life.\nI thought you had resigned yourself@\n\nIt appears I was mistaken@\n\n\n
ÅÑRen's body, having regained the ability to move,\nÅ@clutched at his sword without hesitation.\n\nÅÑThat wordless act in itself lit the signal fire\nÅ@for the fight to begin.\n\n
@Here I come!!\n\n\n
@Hm? @Oh, a child.\n\n\n
@You shouldn't hang around a place like this.\nThere's no telling what might happen.\n\n
Actually, I'm here on business today@\n\n\n
Business? With me?\n\n\n
Yeah, you know a swordsman named <C03>Bordeaux<C04>, right?\n\n\n
Bordeaux?\nAh, that greenhorn.\n\n
Greenhorn?\n\n\n
Yes, a real fool. No matter how many times I've\ndefeated him, he doesn't hesitate to challenge me.\n\n
His swordsmanship still needs a lot of work.\nHence, a greenhorn.\n\n
Though@ He has potential.\n\n\n
As a human being he will naturally grow in age,\nbut he will progress in a great many other ways\ntoo.\n
So, what's the deal?\n\n\n
Ah, about the rematch you agreed to@\n\n\n
He's decided on the place and time and asked me\nto pass it on.\n\n
Hoh? I can't wait.\n\n\n
There's not much you get to look forward to when\nyou live in a place like this, after all.\n\n
No matter how many times he loses, he is still a\nfool. But, I don't hate fools like that.\n\n
Tell him that I'll be waiting.\n\n\n
Great.\n\n\n
Well, I'd best be off then.\n\n\n
A moment, if you please.\n\n\n
Hm?\n\n\n
From the looks of it, it seems like you also dabble\nin the sword. How about it?\nAre you up for some training with me?\n
Geh@ You sound just like my captain.\n\n\n
A-anyway, my job here is finished, so I'm heading\nback!\n\n
See you.\n\n\n
@He appears to have much potential too.\n\n
Phew@\n\n\n
ÅÑHaving finished his first quest, Ren looked at\nÅ@the rewards he'd earned with a satisfied smile.\n\n
ÅÑCharnet approached him from behind the counter.\n\n\n
Good work.\nSo, now do you understand how things run from\naccepting a request to completing it?\n
As for what's next, you could continue doing\nquests, or, you could just do your own thing\nin the ruins. You're free to do as you like!\n
And, now that I've tested your skills, I'll leave\nthis key for the ruins in your care.\n\n
If you can't get any further without this key,\nVeres won't be able to investigate@\n\n
Don't worry.\nI gave one to your friend earlier.\n\n
You just missed each other.\n\n\n
I see.\n\n\n
He said he had something else to look into, but\nI wonder what it was@\n\n
Oh, one more thing. I spoke to the owners of the\n<C03>Blacksmith<C04> and the <C03>Item Shop<C04> that we have here in\nLiruka Village, so you should pop round later.\n
You'll be needing their help for the road ahead,\nand you might be able to ask them for advice\nabout your mission too.\n
The Blacksmith and Item Shop, huh@?\nAlright. I'll pay them a visit later.\n\n
Well, good luck with your investigation.\nI'll be cheering you on from behind.\n\n
ÅÑAnd with that, Charnet went back to the other\nÅ@person she was helping.\n\n
ÅÑRen looked at his rewards again.\n\n
@This isn't so bad, I guess.\n\n\n
ÅÑThe treasure slumbering in the ancient ruins@\nÅ@The band of monsters ready to attack@\n\n
ÅÑIt was so faint that the person himself hadn't\nÅ@noticed, the quiet throbbing of his own heart@\n\n
@@\n\n\n
Strange@ There's a fire here.\n\n\nDid someone abandon their bonfire@?\n\n\n
ÅÑHaving found a blazing fire, Ren slowly drew\nÅ@closer to warm his cold body.\n\n
It's unexpectedly cold in these ruins@\nThis thing's a lifesaver.\n\n
ÅÑHolding both hands out to the crackling fire,\nÅ@he surrendered his body to the warmth.\n\nÅÑ@@@\n\n\n
@Umm@\n\n\n
@\n\n\n
Hello, good sir?\n\n\n
Mm@ Maybe I'm imagining things?\n\n\n
No, it is no such thing.\n\n\n
Yeah, just my imagination@\n\n\n
--W-wait?! Who's there!?\n\n\n
I am right here.\n\n\n
W-where!? Show yourself!!\n\n\n
As I said, I'm right here, in front of you.\n\n\n
In front of me@? It can't be, this fire--!?\n\n\n
IndeedÅ` You finally realised?\n\n\n
No, well@ All the other fireball monsters are\nalways moving around, but you didn't move at all@\n\n
Haha, I seeÅ` Lately, I haven't been feeling too\nwell, so I decided to rest here.\n\n
I suppose my actions really have been out of\ncharacter for one such as myself.\n\n
Out of character@?\n\n\n
Were you the one who helped an archaeologist\ncalled <C03>Mizuka<C04>?\n\n
Mizuka@ I don't know anyone by that name,\nalthough@\n\n
Not long ago, there was an incident where I guided\na lost woman to the exit@?\n\n
That's the one. So it was you.\n\n\n
But, why would guiding someone to the exit make\nyou get sick?\n\n
Well@ It is embarrassing to admit this, but@\n\n\n
We, light-emitting beings are vulnerable to sunlight.\n\n\n
It seems I was exposed to light, be it a small\namount, as I went near the vicinity of the exit.\n\n
Ever since then, I have been resting here@\n\n\n
@I see.\n\n\n
Well, thanks to you, it seems that I will be able\nto move again soon.\n\n
@Can I ask you something?\n\n\n
By all means.\n\n\n
Why did you go out of your way to show Mizuka\nto the exit, knowing that you are vulnerable to\nlight?\n
@I could never abandon a woman in need.\n\n\n
I am a gentlemen, after all.\n\n\n
@That so?\n\n\n
Well, anyway.\nI've a message she asked me to pass on.\n\n
ÅgThank you."\n\n\n
I only did what was right.\nI need no thanks.\n\n
Well, it's about time that I was off.\nDo take care.\n\n
@He was a pretty cool guy@ for a fireball.\n\n\n
But with this stone, I can obtain power that\ntranscends yours@!\n\n
I'll be the centre of attention once again!\n\n\n
And for that, you@\n\n\n
That's not all.\n\n\n
When we were guarding the castle together@\nEver since we first met Elsa, I've been in love\nwith her.\n
@A princess with a mere knight.\nI know it doesn't fit.\n\n
@But my mind was set.\n\n\n
And yet, the one that Elza has always had eyes\nfor@ is you.\n\n
@\n\n\n
I'm going to kill you, take Elza and@ rule the\nworld.\n\n
Rule the world@?\nJust how far are you planning to go@?\n\n
I will rule over@ all@\nThis world@\n\n
H-hey@ Veres!?\n\n\n
Uooooooooooggghhhh!!!!!!!\n\n\n
Graaaaaaaar@!\n\n\n
Ver@es@ You@\n\n\n
Graaaaaaaar!!\n\n\n
He was@ completely swallowed by its power@\n\n\n
@If I leave things like this, it'll be like the\nancient civilisation all over again@\n\n
@\n\n\n
@Elza@ I will protect you@\nI'll keep you safe, no matter what!!\n\n
ÅÑRen gripped the sword in his hand tightly,\nÅ@gathering the determination to defeat his\nÅ@friend@\n
This is the Magicite, huh?\n\n\n
With this stone, I can obtain power.\nThe power to never lose, even to him@\n\n
Veres!!\n\n\n
@It figures, Ren. I didn't think you would lose,\nbut@ You really do astound me.\n\n
Veres, what are you thinking?\n\n\n
Didn't we come here with the mission to take the\nstone back to the Archduke?!\n\n
You know, don't you?\n@If he gets the power of this stone, there's no\nway it'll be used to do good.\n
@\n\n\n
For military purposes, to take over the world@\nIf the power is gonna be used for such crap@\n@I'll use it.\n
@What!?\n\n\n
ÅÑEntrusting himself to the massive piece of\nÅ@Magicite, Veres held out his hands and\nÅ@embraced it.\n
ÅÑA pale blue glow began to enshroud his body@\n\n\n
Stop! Veres! You saw that huge giant, right!?\nDo you want to turn into that too!?\n\n
Uooooooohhhhh!!!!!!\n\n\n
Veres!!!!\n\n\n
@\n\n\n
Y-You@\n\n\n
It's okay, Ren.\nI haven't changed.\n\n
@But, I have obtained power.\nI won't lose to you anymore.\n\n
Not at sword fighting, nor Elza@\n\n\n
Elza?\n\n\n
@Oi, Veres. What are you on about@?\n\n\n
This place shall be our castle.\nBut first@ I'll start with that.\n\n
ÅÑWithout another word, Veres disappeared.\n\n\n
ÅÑRen was convinced that he had already been\nÅ@taken in by the power of the stone.\n\n
@Elza's in danger.\n\n\n
ÅÑRen still had no idea of what Veres was planning.\nÅ@\n\n
ÅÑBut even so, he could tell that Elza was in\nÅ@trouble.\n\n
Well, speaking of@ About the nation of Reville in\nthat book I showed you before@\n\n
Apparently, they're the ones who used alchemy to\ncreate Magicite in the days of Edenbar, which was\ndestroyed a thousand years ago.\n
Using alchemy@ to make Magicite?\n\n\n
@It's getting more and more unbelievable.\nAlchemy is the stuff of fiction, right?\n\n
But, the stone really exists.\n\n\n
@To create a miraculous stone, you need a\nmiraculous power.\n\n
There's a lot we don't know, but now you've gotta\nbelieve at least that much, right?\n\n
@I guess so.\n\n\n
So, it's said that ancient civilization's collapse\nwas due to their over-reliance on the power of\nMagicite@\n
Meaning, the Ågsin committed by the nation of\nRevilleÅh mentioned in that book is that they\ncreated the Magicite.\n
@That makes sense.\nDoes that mean this stone is that dangerous?\n
Well, it's hard to say much without seeing the real\nthing, plus, it was an order from the Archduke.\n\n
It doesn't make a difference whatever we think\nhere.\n\n
@\n\n\n
Besides, if things go well@\n@This could be a great opportunity.\n\n
Hm? Did you say something?\n\n\n
N-no, nothing.\n\n\n
I'll try to find out more about it for now, so\ngood luck with everything on your end.\n\n
H-hey! Wait a sec--\n@He never listens to a word anyone else has to\nsay, that guy.\n
ÅÑVeres left quickly, before he'd even had the\nÅ@chance to hear Ren calling.\n\n
@\n\n\n
The Magicite was created by the nation of Reville,\nhuh@?\n\n
@\n\n\n
What..?\nMy right hand feels@ off@\n\n
ÅÑSuddenly feeling something strange in his right\nÅ@hand, Ren subconsciously drew his sword.\n\n
Somehow, I feel like I'm overflowing with more power\nthan usual@\n@What is this?\n
ÅÑRen couldn't hide his bewilderment at the power\nÅ@overflowing from his right hand.\n\n
ÅÑIt crossed his mind that until just then, he had\nÅ@been holding the fragment of Magicite in that\nÅ@same  hand.\n
ÅÑIf this is the power of that stone@\n\n\n
ÅÑHad Veres not noticed it@ or@?\n\n\n
ÅÑWhilst running that question through his mind\nÅ@without solution, something suddenly appeared\nÅ@from beneath the ground.\n
Gaaaoorr----!!!\n\n\n
I-it's huge!?\nThis thing was in the sand--!?\n\n
@Damn.\nAnything really is possible in this place.\n\n
Gaaaoorr----!!!\n\n\n
@I've got no choice, huh?\n\n\n
ÅÑDetermined, Ren gripped the sword tightly in his\nÅ@hand and pointed it at the giant sand snake.\n\n
ÅÑRen signed the request and placed it next to\nÅ@Charnet, who was busy seeing to someone else.\n\n
ÅÑThen, with perfect timing, the other visitor\nÅ@left, and Charnet returned to check over\nÅ@the piece of paper.\n
Perfect. Looks like that didn't give you any\ntrouble.\n\n
Now, all you have to do is fulfil the conditions,\nand then come back here.\nPiece of cake, right?\n
Complete the request, <C03>return to the guild, and\nreport my results<C04>@\n\n
I figured as much.\n@Don't treat me like a kid.\n
Oh? Did I hit a nerve?\n\n\n
@@\n\n\n
Hehehe. Sorry, sorry.\n\n\n
Ah, right. Almost forgot!\nThis is for you, since you're new here.\n\n
It's a map of the ruins.\n@Well, it's actually just a piece of paper and\na pen.\n
Anyway, as you walk around the ruins, you can\nfinish it yourself.\n\n
And, there's also a guide published by the guild\naimed at helping new treasure hunters get started.\n\n
You've got to look out for yourself.\nMake sure you have a read through it so you don't\nend up regretting it later in floods of tears.\n
<C05>    Å@ÅyMap of the RuinsÅz<C04>\n\n When you're inside the ruins,\n a map will be displayed on the\n lower screen.\n<C03> The map will automatically update\n whenever you enter a new room.<C04>\n Try walking through every nook \n and cranny to complete it.

A guide to exploring@ hm.\n\n\n
As with anything, you need to have a firm grasp\nof the basics, right?\n\n
Especially when it comes to suspicious men who\nlook more like kids, wouldn't-you-say?\n\n
@\n\n\n
Well then, time for you head off to the ruins and\ncomplete that request.\n\n
Yeah, I'll have it done in no time.\n\n\n
ÅÑPeeling himself away from the counter, Ren\nÅ@waved to Charnet and quickly made his way\nÅ@out of the guild.\n
Let's see@ Hmmm@\nAhh@ Interesting@\n\n
What is it?\n\n\n
This book appears to date back to the ancient\ncivilisation. It seems to be about a <C03>permanent skill<C04>\nwhich allows you to perform <C03>Evasive Manoeuvres<C04>.\n
<C03>Evasive Manoeuvres<C04>?\n\n\n
Yes@ To summarise it@\n\n\n
Åg@By curling your body into a small ball and\nrolling quickly, you'll be able to pass through\nnarrow paths with ease@\n
It can also help you to avoid enemy attacks@"\n\n
It sounds kinda weird@\n\n\n
But, if you come across somewhere where it's\ntoo narrow to walk through, or think an enemy\nis about to strike@\n
@Then it might be worth giving this <C03>evasive\nmanoeuvre<C04> thing a shot, right?\n\n
Yeah, no harm in trying.\n\n\n
<C05>Å@Å@Å@Å@Å@ INFORMATION<C04>\n\n<C03>Å@ÅyPermanent SkillsÅz<C04>\nÅ@These begin to take effect\nÅ@as soon as they're learnt.\n\n<C03>Å@ÅyAssigned SkillsÅz<C04>\nÅ@Once learnt, the skill must\nÅ@be allocated to take effect.\nÅ@(SP is required)
<C05>Å@Å@Å@Å@Å@ INFORMATION<C04>\n\nÅ@You can visit ÅgSkillsÅh from\nÅ@the menu to <C03>view permanent\nÅ@skills<C04> and <C03>equip assigned skills<C04>.\n\nÅ@It's worth checking whenever\nÅ@you learn a new skill.\n
Just like this, if you bring a book that contains\ninformation about a skill to the guild, I'll teach\nyou about it.\n
Only then will you be able to learn the skill.\n\n\n
So@ in order to learn a skill, I have to <C03>bring\nthe skill book back with me from the ruins, and\ntake it here, to the guild<C04>.\n
Exactly.\n\n\n
Just remember that once you've found a book, it\nwon't be effective immediately.\n\n
Got it.\n\n\n
Still@ having to go all the way back to the exit\nevery time I find a book is such a pain@\n\n
I wouldn't worry about that.\n\n\n
You might already know this, but there's a tool\nthat allows you to instantly travel from the\nruins back to the village that you can use.\n
Since I have one spare, I'll let you have it.\nCall it a special service for newcomers.\n\n
If you need more, you can buy them at the Item\nShop@\n\n
@or, if you've got all the materials, you can make\none by mixing them together.\n\n
If I'm not mistaken, the recipe is <C03>Fascina Powder<C04>\nand@ what was that other one again?\n\n
Well anyways, I think you probably still have some\nways go before you'll be ready to make that@\n\n
So for now, you'll have to buy them whilst you\nfocus on learning the basics and collecting\nmaterials.\n
Right. Thanks for your help.\n\n\n
Oh, no need to thank me.\n\n\n
@Just be sure to see to the guild's request\nlist, okay?\n\n
@Was that your motive all along?\n\n\n
Hehehe. I'm kidding.\nWell, more like half-kidding.\n\n
Now then@\nWas there something else you wanted?\n\n
@\n\n\n
@A way to draw out that power@ to the body@\nNo@ But@\n\n

@Being overwhelmed by that power@\nMaybe I'm overthinking it@ But, that method@\n\n

Wah!?\n--Ren!? When did you get here!?\n\n
@I've been here the whole time.\n\n\n
Popping up without a sound@\nYou're like a ghost.\n\n
@Isn't it just you who was too busy being spaced\nout?\n\n
W-well anyway, perfect timing!\n\n\n
I was actually just thinking of giving this to you.\n\n
A key for the ruins?\nWhy are you giving it to me?\n\n
There's something I want to check up, so I'm\nheading back to the castle for a bit.\n\n
That's why I thought you could use the key to do\na bit of investigating ahead of me.\n\n
@That's unusual.\n\n\n
What is?\n\n\n
Normally, you'd say something about being the\nfirst one there and run off with the key.\n\n
@I-is that right?\n\n\n
Yeah.\n\n\n
@W-well I guess I've done a bit of growing up too.\n\n\n
Right, I'm off to the castle now, so@\nI'll leave that key to you.\n\n
Wait!\nI haven't finished talking with you--!\n\n
@What's so important that he's got to rush\nover there for?\n\n

<C05>Å@Å@Å@Å@Å@ INFORMATION<C04>\n\n ÅyRutila KeyÅz<C04> obtained.\n\n Now you can advance past <C03>the\n door<C04> that was locked@\n\n You know, the one with green\n walls where a monster holding a\n club lies in ambush. That room.
Somehow@ the air in here feels different to the\nprevious rooms@\n\n
ÅÑRen, having made it deep into the first layer,\nÅ@felt a sense of unease at the strange\nÅ@atmosphere which had settled in the room.\n
ÅÑThen, hearing footsteps coming from one of\nÅ@the corners, he quickly put up his guard.\n
@!\n\n\n
Yo.\n\n\n
Veres? @Don't scare me like that.\n\n\n
OopsÅ` Sorry, my bad.\nBy the way, is your search going well?\n\n
I haven't made that much progress.\n\n\n
How about you?\nThat other thing you were on about@\n\n
Huh? @Oh, that thing.\nWell, I'm getting there, inch by inch.\n\n
But never mind that, I found something interesting.\nHave a read of this.\n\n
ÅÑVeres took out an old book and handed it to\nÅ@Ren.\n\n
@It's so dirty that it's hard to read.\nLet's see@\n\n
ÅgWe have committed a terrible sin@\nThis stone is something that shouldn't exist@\n\n
Some people worship our nation of Reville as\ngods@ but that is a mistake.\n\n
No matter how superior our skills, we are still\nonly human.\n\n
@No, we are less.\n\n\n
We tread foot into a realm that should never\nbe touched by human hands@Åh\n\n
ÅÑRen read aloud the page that Veres had shown\nÅ@him.\n\n
It seems like it's a record from ancient times,\nbut@\n\n
I got the impression this ÅeNation of Reville' it\nmentions must have been heavily intertwined\nwith these ruins.\n
The ÅgNation of RevilleÅh, huh?\n@That's the first I've heard of them.\n\n
Well, I've got this part covered so you should get\nback to searching for the Magicite.\n\n
I'm counting on you!\n\n\n
H-hey! Veres!\n\n\n
ÅÑWithout regard to the voice calling out to him,\nÅ@Veres disappeared into another room.\n\n
@@@\n\n\n
@That book certainly got my attention.\n\n\n
ÅeThe Nation of Reville@'\nPeople worshiped them like gods, but they had\ncommitted a huge sin@\n
@That alone has me lost.\n\n\n
ÅÑRen, trying to wrap his head around the content\nÅ@of the passage he just read, was unaware that\nÅ@he was making a big mistake@\n
ÅÑ@having forgotten the eerie atmosphere he'd\nÅ@first felt when entering the room, before\nÅ@Veres had interrupted.\n
ÅÑThat's when@\n\n\n
Grrrrrr@\n\n\n
What the-- That thing is@?\n\n\n
ÅÑRight in front of him was a ginormous beast\nÅ@with three heads.\n\n
ÅÑIt's hostility was plain for all to see.\n\n\n
I've never seen a creature like this before@\n\n\n
Is this another effect of the mysterious stone\nknown as ÅeMagicite'?\n\n
Grrrrrr@\n\n\n
@This is no time be lost in thought!\nI've gotta do something that thing first@!\n\n
ÅÑRen shook his head and gripped at the sword\nÅ@at his waist@\n\n
@Phew.\n\n\n
I wonder if that's the first layer pretty much\ninvestigated now.\n\n
Oi! You there!\n\n\n
@What?\n\n\n
Yo. Is the search going well?\n\n\n
Ah, the blacksmith@\n\n\n
Um@ what was it again?\n\n\n
Lagnus!!\n\n\n
Sheesh@ And to think I came all this way Åecoz I\nhave some info for you@\n\n
@Maybe I'll just leave.\n\n\n
S-sorry. I was just kidding.\n\n\n
So@ Mr Lagnus.\nWhat was the info you had for me?\n\n
Have you been having trouble gathering material?\n\n\n
@It's hard to be efficient, I guess.\n\n\n
Ain't it just?\n\n\n
Still, the grass might be the same, but did you\nknow you can pick up different items depending on\nwhere it is? @The same goes for monsters too.\n
There are materials that can and cannot be\ncollected from monsters with the exact same name.\n\n
@In general, the higher quality materials needed\nto make stronger weapons are in the possession\nof the monsters further inside the ruins.\n
So if you want a certain material, but can't seem\nget it no matter how many you kill@\n\n
@then check to see if there any similar monsters\nelsewhere.\n\n
@That makes sense.\n\n\n
And, I have this for you.\n\n\n
Is this a key for the ruins? Why are you giving it\nto me?\n\n
A customer asked me to go to the ruins to collect\nsome material for making a sword@\n\n
@and I just happened to find it then.\n\n\n
I'm not all that interested in the depths of the\nruins, plus I have no time to go and see them.\n\nThat's why I thought I'd give it to you.\n
@I think it's better that it's used for research\nrather than going to someone who just wants to\ntry and dig up treasure.\n
Wow@ You really are a good guy, Lagnus.\n\n\n
That'sÅgMr Lagnus" to you!\n\n\n
Thank you@ Mr Lagnus.\n\n\n
Much better!\n\n\n
Well, I'm gonna get back.\nIf you find yourself wanting a weapon, pop round!\n\n
<C05>Å@Å@Å@Å@Å@ INFORMATION<C04>\n\n <C03>ÅySapphyri KeyÅz<C04> obtained.\n\n Now you can advance past <C03>the\n door<C04> that was locked@\n\n Eh? You've forgotten about it?\n @Come on now, the door's in\n that looong room. Remember?
@Hey. Took you long enough.\n\n\n
@?\n\n\n
ÅÑThat odd room was so unlike any other, it truly\nÅ@felt like entering a different dimension.\n\n
ÅÑAnd there, loitering around in such a place was\nÅ@Veres.\n\n
ÅÑUnable to suppress the unnaturally foreign\nÅ@feeling building up inside of him, Ren gripped a\nÅ@hand around his sword@\n
@Huh? Why are you pointing your sword at me?\n\n\n
Are you@ really Veres?\n\n\n
Hehehe@\nWhat weird stuff are you spouting?\n\n
Any way you look at it, it's me, right?\n\n
ÅÑIt certainly looked like Veres, but sensing that\nÅ@something inside him had changed, he seemed like\nÅ@a different person to Ren's eyes.\n
ÅÑVeres' hand was wrapped tightly around a\nÅ@fragment of Magicite.\n\n
Veres! You need to throw that stone away!\nThat stone is--!\n\n
Quiet.\n\n\n
@You see, this stone@ It spoke to me@\nÅgPower@ I'll give you power@Åh\n\n
This is what I have been looking for@\n@I won't let anyone get in my way.\n\n
Veres@ You@\n\n\n
Ren, you might have already figured this out\nbefore you came here, but@\n\n
Not only can you use the power within the Magicite\nitself, but there is also a way draw it out.\n\n
@\n\n\n
@That is, embedding the power of the stone into\nthe human body.\n\n
Embedded with a stone, humans can obtain a power\nthat transcends even God!\n\n
But@ If you can't control that power and are\nswallowed by it, you'll turn into an atrocious\nmonster@\n
By the way, the real cause of the ancient\ncivilization's collapse is that monster@ The\nÅgancient giant" who destroyed all civilization.\n
@!?\n\n\n
But foolishly, the world the ancient giant\ndestroyed was also the source of its power,\nthe ÅgMagicite".\n
By refusing its roots, the giant fell into a long\nslumber.\n\n
After that, the survivors of the Nation of\nReville sealed the Magicite and the giant\ndeep underground.\n
That's-- These ruins..!?\n\n\n
Correct.\n\n\n
Now then@ I really should be going soon.\nIt's not yet time for me to deal with you.\n\n
Sorry, but play with this guy for me, won't you?\n\n\n
ÅÑAs he spoke, Veres threw the fragment of\nÅ@Magicite he had been holding into the darkness\nÅ@below.\n
If it were me, it would be hopeless, but@\nYou'll be able to figure something out.\nRight, Ren@?\n
ÅÑLeaving the room behind him, Veres' eyes swelled\nÅ@with loneliness@\n
ÅÑRen immediately tried to run after him, when he\nÅ@heard a roar bellowing from the place where\nÅ@the fragment of Magicite had been thrown.\n
It can't be@\n\n\n
Graaaaaaaar@!\n\n\n
Did he use the fragment of Magicite to wake the\nancient giant?\n\n
Damn it. I have to stop Veres before he does\nanything else stupid@\n\n
@But first, I'd better do something about this.\n\n\n
ÅÑThe ancient giant looked around slowly, as if it\nÅ@were trying to get a read on the situation.\n
@\n\n\n
ÅgYou'll be able to figure something out", huh?\n@Yeah. I can handle this.\n\n
ÅÑDetermined, Ren stared at the giant, many times\nÅ@his own size.\n\n
Come on, Monster!\nI'll play with you@\n\n
ÅÑAs if in response, the giant raised his huge\nÅ@hands above is head@\n\n
I owe you@ an apology@\n\n\n
I think what I said to you earlier was all stuff\nthat I had locked away in my heart@\n\n
@Stuff that I have always, always wanted to say\nbut couldn't@ Another me@\n\n
Being in love with Elza@ Despising Ren@\nThe other me@\n\n
@No, not hate.\nJust@\n\n
I was jealous@ of you@\n\n\n

But that's all it was@ I don't really@\n\n\n
@It's true, I've always felt inferior to you@\n\n\n
But@ still@ To the me who only had a sword to\ncling to as a kid, you were my first friend@\n\n
@ÅeIf I use the Magicite's power, I might surpass\nyou, even a little'@\nÅeI'll get stronger, and surprise you'@\n
Those thoughts@ just kept growing@ until even\nI@ couldn't stop it anymore@\n\n
@Ren@ I'm sorry@\n\n\n
@That's enough. Don't talk any more.\n\n\n
@Ngh@\nAnd@ Elza@\n\n
@\n\n\n
Even though I lost control@\nI@ I really am sorry for what I did to you@\n\n

@\n\n\n
@I'm going to look around the ruins again.\n\n\n
@Huh?\n\n\n
Because of the existence of this stone, the\nancient civilization and@ Veres were brought\nto their knees.\n
Because of this stone@!\n\n\n
@Ren.\n\n\n
That's why I'm going to make sure there's no\nother stones left, so no one will make the\nsame mistake again.\n
After that, I'll visit the ancient ruins around\nthe world, and destroy every single stone.\n\n
That's something I can do@\nSomething I have to do, I think.\n\n

@Me too.\nNow that my father has passed away, I am the\nonly one who can lead the country.\n

No. It's going to be even better than before@\nSo@\n\n
Make sure you come back safe.\n\n\n
Yeah. I Åepromise'.\nI will definitely return.\n\n
ÅÑOn the main street of Liruka Village@\n\n\n
ÅÑRen opened the door of a flashy-looking shop\nÅ@with the sign ÅeAvanc's Item Shop'.\n\n
Welcome.\n\n\n
ÅÑThe one who had greeted him was a small\nÅ@beastman.\n\n
ÅÑIt looked like he was lounging about on top of\nÅ@the counter, but by sitting there, he was just\nÅ@about able to meet Ren at eye level.\n
Oh my my! I haven't seen your face beforre.\nArrre you new?\n\n

Ah! So you're the new registrrree, Ren?\nI hearrrd the news.\n\n
I'm Avanc!\nNice to meet you!\n\n
Ah, likewise.\n\n\n
So, this is the item shop, right?\nIs there anyone else around?\n\n
As you see, Avanc is the only one!\nThis is Avanc's Item Shop!\n\n
Wow@ Even though you're so tiny.\n\n\n
My size is irrrelevant!!\n\n\n
Besides, Avanc's shop has a reputation forrr\nhaving a wide range of stock!\n\n
If it's items you're afterrr, we have tools and\nmaterials! If it's equipment, there's swords, knifes\nand accessories!\n
If you have money, you can get whatever you want!\n\n\n
And, do you see the <C03>big pot<C04> over therrre?\n\n\n
Big pot?\n\n\n
Err@\n\n\n
Oh, you mean this?\n\n\n
ÅÑRen replied, pointing at the pot that was stood\nÅ@next to the counter.\n\n
Yes! That's the one!\n\n\n
That pot is the Åemixing pot'. Just add materials\nand give it a little stirrr@\n\n
@and they'll be mixed together in the lick of a\npaw, giving you a new item or piece of equipment.\nA truly marrrvelous invention!\n
HehÅ` That does sound handy.\n@But I'm a bit scared that you haven't brought\nup anything about the fee to use it.\n
Non, non, non!\nTherrre is nothing to be scared of!\n\n
You can use the pot as much as you want,\nwhenever you want, frrree of charge.\n\n
@Free of charge?\n\n\n

ÅÑRen placed the book he received into the\nÅ@ÅgKeyÅh category of his bag.\n\n

Alright. I'll take a look.\nThank you.\n\n
No no no no no, it's the least I can do.\n\n\n
I n   e x c h a n g e--!\n\n\n
Since you took the trouble of coming here, you\nshould have a look at my warrres.\n\n
I've assembled all sorrrts of essential items\nfor explorring the ruins!\n\n
Well well well, what would you like?\n\n\n
ÅÑThe Adventurers Guild, Liruka Village Branch.\n\n\nÅÑIt seemed to have become a base for those who\nÅ@were exploring the ruins, as it was packed full\nÅ@despite being located in a small village.\nÅÑWith four circular tables and a row of counters,\nÅ@the small room was bustling night and day.\n\nÅÑPeople laughing and drinking@\nÅ@Those stood around quietly@\n\nÅÑThe adventures were enjoying passing the time,\nÅ@when the groan of the door opening sounded\nÅ@the arrival of new visitors.\n
Oh, welcome.\n\n\n
ÅÑThe first person to speak was a beautiful\nÅ@woman, stood over the counter.\n\n
Whooooa!\nThat lady is crazy gorgeous, right@?\n\n
We're after Liruka Village's Guild, is this the right\nplace?\n\n
@Oi, so you're actually starting to ignore me now?\n\n\n
I haven't seen your faces around here before.\nJudging by those outfits, I'd guess you're from\nthe capital?\n
Yeah. We're here to investigate the ancient ruins,\nby order of the Archduke of Kucellbull.\nI'm Ren, one of the Duchy Knights.\n
Likewise, I'm Veres, a knight of the dukedom.\nPleased to make your acquaintance.\n\n
Oh, it's you?\nI'd heard the news, but I wasn't expecting you to\nbe so young.\n
Heh heh. We get that a lot.\n\n\n
ÅÑVeres ogled her, as if he hadn't already stared\nÅ@hard enough.\n\n
I'm Charnet. The Adventurers Guild, Liruka Village\nBranch's receptionist, and Guildmaster.\n\n
Miss Charnet, you say@?\nWhat an elegant name.\n\n
Why, thank you.\n\n\n
@By the way, where are these ancient ruins that\nwere uncovered?\n\n
They were discovered several months ago, in a\nforest to the east of the village, but@\n\n
From the tales I've heard from the treasure\nhunters who went in before, it seems like it's\nquite the dangerous place, you know?\n
Don't worry about that!\nWe might not look the part, but we are knights.\n\n
A fair point.\nWell then, could you write your names on these\npapers?\n
ÅÑAs she spoke, Charnet pulled two pieces of\nÅ@paper out of a drawer in the counter, and\nÅ@handed them to the men.\n
@Our names?\n\n\n
Yes.Å@You don't know? Before you can enter\nhistoric relics, you must register with the\nguild overseeing that jurisdiction.\n
Even though you're here by order of the\nArchduke, there are no exceptions. If you're going\nto enter the ruins, register with the guild.\n
Seriously@\nWe're gonna join the treasure hunters?\n\n
ÅÑHesitating, Veres gave a sideways glance at\nÅ@Ren, who had already finished writing his name.\n\n
It's fine, so get writing.\n\n\n
Ack! You didn't even give it a second thought,\ndid you!?\nYou sure work fast@\n
ÅÑNames signed, they handed their papers back to\nÅ@Charnet.\n
All present and correct.\nWell then, you're all set to head off to the\nruins, but first@\n
By registering with a guild, you can receive a\nvariety of benefits to help you with your\nadventure. For instance@\n
ÅÑCharnet, producing piles of paperwork out of\nÅ@nowhere, threw them down onto the countertop\nÅ@with a heavy thud.\n
These are@?\n\n\n
Requests that the guild has received about the\nruins.\n\n
People who have registered with the guild can\naccept these requests by paying a small contract\nfee.\n
If you manage to fulfil the request, you'll be\nrewarded for your work, and may even get some\nnew information about the ruins.\n
It might even lead to developments in your\ninvestigation@\nThis could prove to be key to your mission.\n
Err, no@ This and that seem like two different\nthings.\n\n
Well, don't be so hard-nosed, you might as well\ntry accepting one for now. Right?\n\n
ÅÑRen and Veres exchanged glances, staring at\nÅ@the mountain of requests piled in front of\nÅ@them.\n
Ah@ Ren, sorry! I just remembered, I was asked\nto see to another matter regarding our search\nof the ruins.\n
@Another matter?\nThat's the first I've heard of it.\n\n
It's a really important mission!\nSo, this is where we'll have to part ways. I'll\nleave this place to you.\n
I'm counting on you, buddy!\n\n\n
ÅÑWith those parting words, Veres left the guild\nÅ@in a flash.\n\n
ÅÑLeft all alone, Charnet stared at Ren with a\nÅ@daring smile.\n\n
ÅÑRen reluctantly picked up one of the request\nÅ@papers.\n\n
Phew@ I'm kinda tired.\n\n\n
@I guess this is as good a place as any to take\na break.\n\n

@\n\n\n
@Then, may I share my story with you?\n\n\n
Go ahead.\n\n\n
I@ have been in these ruins for a long, long time.\n\n\n
I don't know the exact time anymore.\n\n
But, when I was alive, I was involved in the\nconstruction of this site.\n\n
The construction of the ruins@\nOi oi, you're talking over a thousand years ago.\n\n
That's about right.\n\n\n
Well, I say construction, but it was actually made\nusing the art of alchemy.\n\n
Alchemy@\n\n\n
@The nation of Reville?\n\n\n
Oh! You know of it!?\n\n\n
@Ah-- No, just the name.\n\n\n
Well, I'm sure you must have also heard of Magicite\nthen.\n\n
As you probably know, Magicite is the result of a\nsuccessful attempt to use alchemy to trap the\npower of nature within a stone.\n
A stone with the power of fire, sets things alight,\na stone with the power of water, drips cold water.\n\n
After conducting such research, we, the people\nof Reville, created the stone hoping that it would\nprove useful for all life@\n
But, the stone, which had become an indispensable\npart of our daily lives, ended up being used as a\ntool for warfare.\n
@Many people died as a result.\n\n\n
Not only people.\nOur civilization itself was also destroyed.\n\n
And, it was us who set it all into motion.\n\n\n
We didn't mean it@\nNot that such an excuse bears any weight, given\nhow incredible a mistake it was.\n
@\n\n\n
We tried to fix our sins@ That is, we sealed away\nall the creatures created by alchemy, and our own\nsouls, inside these walls.\n
@You mean, you all took your lives in these ruins?\n\n\n
Yes, that is correct.\n\n\n
Some found peace and their souls passed from this\nworld@ Others were influenced by the power of\nthe stone and turned into monsters@\n
And, some like me managed to hold onto their sense\nof self and continue to cling to this place,\nperhaps out of guilt.\n
@A little while ago, you said that a thousand\nyears have passed since the site was created,\nyes?\n
@Even after that much time has passed, the\nregrets still do not fade.\n\n
@Why, why did we make such a thing@?\n\n
The fault isn't with the people who created it.\nIt's the ones who used it that are to blame.\n\n
@I can't comfort you with those words.\n\n\n
I think a creator has to take responsibility for\nwhat they create.\n\n
But haven't you taken your fair share of\nresponsibility?\n\n
In the outside world, humanity has been taking\nsteps forward for hundreds of years.\n\n
Nobody thinks much of what happened here\nanymore.\n\n
@That's not to say that you shouldn't care at\nall.\n\n
Just that you shouldn't be so hard on yourself,\nyou know. @I'm not really good at putting it into\nwords.\n
@I know what you are trying to say.\n\n\n
@You're very kind, aren't you?\nAll this time, not once has anyone listened to me\nlike this.\n
That alone is enough.\n@Thank you, truly.\n\n
Ah-- I didn't really do anything to deserve your\nthanks.\n\n
That's not true. Thanks to you, I feel a little\nbetter now.\n\n
If you'd like, please drop by again.\n\n\n
Next time, I'd love to hear your story.\n\n\n
Yeah, I'll stop by if I'm in the area.\n\n\n
Well, keep well@ or, maybe I should say, rest in\npeace soon!\n\n
I think that will still be a way off yet.\n\n\n

ÅÑTucked away in a corner of Liruka Village was\nÅ@a small shop.\n\n

Forge and enhance weapons?\n\n\n
Yeah.\nForging is when you make weapons from scratch@\n\n
@and enhancing is when you change a weapon\nthat already exists into a different weapon.\n\n
By the way, both require materials and money.\n\n\n

Well, there's the guild round here where you\ncan take jobs, or you can go off and gather\nthem on your own.\n

*Fwoo@*\nThey haven't used in a long time so they're\na bit dusty but@ there's life in them yet.\n
ÅÑLagnus had come out from the back holding a\nÅ@sword in each hand.\n\n
Here.\n\n\n
ÅÑHe handed the two differently shaped swords\nÅ@to Ren.\n\n
@These are?\n\n\n
For your first visit only!\nIt's a special service. After this, you'll have to\nshow your Åepatronage', okay?\n
Fyi@ The <C03>Fleuret<C04> is a ÅgMedium SwordÅh, and the \n<C03>Long Sword<C04> is a ÅgBig SwordÅh.\n\n
It's not a big deal, but it might be good to think\nof it as Åepractise' when you use them, at least\nuntil you get used to it.\n
@Speaking of, this is for you too.\n\n
ÅÑRen placed the book he received into the\nÅ@ÅgKeyÅh category of his item pouch.\n\n
The book has a detailed description of the\ncharacteristics of each main weapon category.\n\n
If you want to know the differences between\nSmall Swords, Medium Swords and Big Swords\nthen you should give it a read.\n
<C05>Å@Å@Å@Å@Å@ INFORMATION<C04>\n\n\n    The Main Weapons (swords)\n      are divided into three\n     major categories; Small\n      Swords, Medium Swords\nÅ@       and Big Swords.\n\n
<C05>Å@Å@Å@Å@Å@ INFORMATION<C04>\n\nÅySmall SwordsÅz\nThese swords are light and easy\nto handle, allowing you to make\n<C03>consecutive attacks<C04>.\n\nHowever, the attacks themselves\naren't massively powerful.
<C05>Å@Å@Å@Å@Å@ INFORMATION<C04>\n\nÅyMedium SwordsÅz\nNot too light and not too heavy,\nthese are balanced, easy to use\nswords ideal for beginners.\n\nThey're good in <C03>any situation<C04>, but\nhave no outstanding features.
<C05>Å@Å@Å@Å@Å@ INFORMATION<C04>\n\nÅyBig SwordsÅz\nThese swords have a long reach,\nand great potential. (<C03>They can \nperform charged attacks.<C04>)\n\nBut, there is a pause after each\nattack due to the weight, making\nconsecutive attacks impossible.
Well, to start, don't strain yourself or think\ntoo hard. It's alright to just use them however\nfor now.\n
Right. Thank you.\n@You're a surprisingly nice guy.\n\n
That's ÅeMr Lagnus' to you!\nSheesh. This is why brats without manners are@\n
Well anyway, you should check out the store and\nsee what we have.\n\n
If you already have materials and money, you\ncan get making new weapons straight away.\n\n
So, what'll it be?\n\n\n
\nÅ@Å@Å@Kucellbull Castle    Audience ChamberÅ@ Å@\n\n
ÅÑBy decree of the Archduke Kucellbull, every\nÅ@knight in the duchy had arrived in that small,\nÅ@decorative room.\n
ÅÑThe room was strangely quiet, as if their\nÅ@nerves had barred the sound.\n\n
ÅÑThe knights, sworn to serve their country,\nÅ@couldn't help but feel uneasy about the \nÅ@summons, which they had no right to refuse.\n
ÅÑThey were trying to avoid the gaze of@\n\n\n
ÅÑThe 8th Archduke of Kucellbull.\nÅ@Estrand Kucellbull.\n\n
ÅÑThe Archduke inspected the assembly, and gave\nÅ@a single cough as if to get their attention,\nÅ@before opening his mouth@\n
As most of you are already aware, ancient ruins\nwere recently discovered in Dorius.\n\n
The ruins are said to date back to the civilisation\nof Edenbar, believed to have been destroyed over\none thousand years ago@\n
The archaeologists sent there to investigate were\n@wiped out.\n\n
ÅÑThe abrupt announcement stirred up the room@\n\n\n
ÅÑThe voice of a single knight cut through the\nÅ@noise.\n
@What exactly do you mean by Ågwiped outÅh?\n\n\n
Hrmh. It appears the ruins that were discovered,\nstill aren't dead.\n\n
@Not dead?\n\n\n
Even now, one thousand years since it's\nconstruction, the terrifying traps laid throughout\nthe ruins continue to work. That is to say@\n
Perhaps from the many years of neglect, the\ninterior seems to have turned into a den of\nmonsters.\n
ÅÑThe room fell into a clamour for the second\nÅ@time@\n\n
ÅÑThe men began to question the Archduke.\n\n\n
So, the reason we were summoned is@?\n\n\n
Although the archaeologists are knowledgeable\nabout the ancient civilization, they have no way\nof fighting back against the monsters.\n
Therefore, I'd like you, the Knights of the Duchy,\nto ride for the ancient ruins, destroy the traps\nand monsters inside, and create a path.\n
I see. As you wish, Your Highness.\n\n\n
Oi oi oi, oi oi oi!\nDid you hear that!?\n\n
@Stop making a scene. Your voice is too loud.\n\n\n
ÅeCourse I'm gonna make a scene.\nAn unknown ruin where traps and monsters await@\nAs a man, you can't help but be lured in!\n
Yeah. I guess you're right.\n\n\n
Hah? Your apathy is as plain as ever.\nAren't you excited?\nDoesn't this make your heart start to pound?\n
Don't misunderstand, Veres.\nThis isn't a game. It's work.\n\n
Psht. That hard-headedness of yours never\nchanges@\n\n
You there! Pipe down!\n\n\n
Ehe@ S-sorry.\n\n\n
*Ahem.*\nThen, we shall inform you once a decision is made\nas to when you will depart.\n
Until then, see to it that you make your\npreparations.\n\n
Yes, sire!\n\n\n
ÅÑWith the Archduke's speech over, the knights\nÅ@that had gathered round began to file out of\nÅ@the audience chamber.\n
Veres. We should get going too.\n\n\n
Y-yeah. @Ancient ruins, huh@?\n\n\n
ÅÑA gleeful smile spread across Veres' face, as\nÅ@if he was having a runaway daydream.\n\n
ÅÑRonixis, commander of the Duchy Knights,\nÅ@approached the two men.\n
Veres, can't you do something about that slovenly\nface of yours?\n\n
Oh, C-Captain! Forgive me!\n\n\n
@.Enough.\nMore importantly, the Archduke wishes to speak.\nThe two of you should stay behind.\n
Huh!? ÅgThe two of you@Åh As in, US?\n\n\n
Do you see me talking to anyone else?\n\n\n
For real!?\n\n\n
If it's not about the ruins then@ there's\nsomething else?\n\n
I wonder.\nI haven't heard anything.\n\n
Anyway, make sure you show some respect, else\nI'll be the one taking the blame for it!\n\n
Got it.\n\n\n
We know, we know, Captain.\nLet's go, Ren.\n\n
@I'm not feeling reassured.\n\n\n
Oh, you're here?\n\n\n
We heard that you had something to tell us?\n\n\n
Mmm. The truth is, I'd like you to go on ahead to\nthe ruins, as an advance party.\n\n
@An advance party?\n\n\n
It's dangerous, there's no telling what might\nhappen if I blindly send men in. I hope to ward off\nthe chance of our forces being annihilated.\n
The two of you are still young, but I have heard\nfrom Ronixis that your strength comes guaranteed.\n\n
Your words are too kind.\n\n\n
You humble yourself. Will you do it?\n\n\n
Of course, sire.\n\n\n
Excellent.\n@There is just one more thing.\n\n
What now?\n\n\n
@Are you aware of the stone known as ÅeMagiciteÅf\nsaid to have supported the civilization of\nEdenbar's prosperity from the shadows?\n
ÅÑEven though he was puzzled by the Archduke's\nÅ@sudden question, Ren opened his mouth and\nÅ@quietly started to speak.\n
@A mysterious, sparkling blue crystal imbued with\nthe power of the earth. Whoever possess it will\nobtain powers equal to that of a god@\n
It's a legend that has been passed down for\ngenerations, correct?\n\n
It's true that there are those who will insist\nthat it does not exist, and yet there can be\nno doubt that it was real.\n
What's more, there's a chance that the stone is\nresting within the ancient ruins, still intact.\n\n
So we are@?\n\n\n
As the advance party, the two of you shall creep\ninto the ruins, assess the situation, and ascertain\nwhether or not the ÅeMagiciteÅf exists.\n
And, in the event that you do make a miraculous\ndiscovery, you are to secretly recover it, and\nbring it back to me with the utmost haste.\n
There is no need to let anyone else know about\nthis. Understood?\n\n
@For what purpose would the stone be used?\n\n\n
You need not worry about such things.\nJust focus on completing your mission.\n\n
As you wish, Your Highness.\nAs soon as we find the mysterious stone, we will\nbring straight back to you.\n
Mmm. Then, you should head to the ruins without\ndelay. They were discovered in the Lorayne\ndistrict@ Close to a small village called Liruka.\n
Start by paying a visit to the guild in Liruka.\n\n\n
If you let them know that you're there to inspect\nthe ruins by royal decree, they will see to your\nneeds.\n
Sire! Then, we shall be on our way.\n\n\n
Hrmh. I hope you will return with good news.\n\n\n
Hey! Did you catch that!?\n\n\n
No duh. I was stood right next to you.\n\n\n
So, we'll be going to the ruins first.\nThis oughta be fun.\n\n
Perhaps.\n\n\n
Psht. You really are a dull guy, ya know?\n\n\n
Still@ ÅgMagiciteÅh, eh?\nI always thought it was just a myth.\n\n
But@ It's still bugging me.\nIf the Archduke gets his hands on some, what's\nhe planning to do with it?\n
He just told us not to worry.\nWhatever he wants to use it for is none of\nour business.\n
Don't go all apathetic on me now.\nI mean, what if the Magicite is--\n\n
If I may@\n\n\n
ÅÑThe two men turned around to look at whoever\nÅ@had interrupted them.\n\n
ÅÑStanding there was the eldest daughter of\nÅ@the Archduke, Lady Elza Kucellbull.\n\n
ÅÑHer girlish, pretty face had a slightly solemn\nÅ@expression@\n\n
Elza@?\n\n\n
My my, Lady Elza.\nHow do you do?\n\n
Don't play stupid.\n@I overheard you talking before.\n\n
Before@?\nAh, about us going on ahead to investigate\nthe ruins?\n
Yes, that.\n\n\n
So, you came rushing to congratulate us on\nbeing appointed as the advance party?\n
Well@ It was only natural, given our talents,\nonly naturalÅ`\n\n
That's not it! @I'm worried.\n\n\n
Elza?\n\n\n
I have a bad feeling@\nLike, something's going to happen to the two\nof you@\n
@\n\n\n
Anyways!\nPlease rest assured, Lady Elza.\n\n
Once we've finished our mission, we'll be sure to\ncome back in one piece.\n\n
@Yes, you're right.\nYeah. It'll be okay, won't it?\n\n
Ah@ I should be getting back soon.\n\n\n
Yeah. We'd better be going soon too@\n\n\n
Right.\nWell, we'll be off then, Elza.\n\n
Yes@ But please, be careful.\n\n\n
Sir Ronixis! Hurry!\n\n\n
L-Lady Elza. Please slow down a little@\n\n
Goodness@ You're all over the shop!\n\n\n
Is such behaviour appropriate for the Knight\nCommander?\n\n
Hahaha.\nYou've hit me where it hurts most.\n\n
Still, even though you were finally given permission\nby the Archduke to leave the city@\n\n
Whatever made you want to come all this way to\nsuch an empty village?\n\n
Well, Ren are Veres are in this village right now,\naren't they?\n\n
Wha--\nYou came all this way just to see those two!?\n\n
Yes, that's right.\nEspecially Ren, he never shows his face whenever\nhe comes back to the castle, you know?\n
That's why I thought I'd go to see him.\n\n
@Lady Elza. I have been by your side for a long\ntime now, so I know@\n\n
You have not been able to make any friends your\nown age@ That can be lonely, or you may have\nalready had to lock away those feelings.\n
But when I see you with that noble air, befitting\nof a princess, it makes me proud.\n\n
However, since meeting those two, I fear you may\nhave crossed the line of proper conduct@\n\n
@\n\n\n
I know what I've said is rude.\n\n\n
I don't mean to cause offense. It's just, you are\nthis dukedom's princess, and they are but knights.\n\n
Please bear the weight of that in mind so that\nyou do not act irresponsibly.\n\n
@I'm well aware.\n\n\n
Lady Elza@\n\n\n
Ren is always telling me the same thing, and, when\nI'm talking to them, I feel the existence of that\ninvisible wall even stronger@\n
@\n\n\n
But regardless, we did come all this way.\nI am allowed to talk to them, right?\n\n
@You're right.\nRegrettably, it seems I am your only bodyguard,\nand just for today, I shall overlook it.\n
Thank you.\n\n\n
Then, I'll head to the village guild to ask for\nnews of Ren and Veres.\n\n
Lady Elza, please wait here for me.\n\n\n
Right. I'll leave it to you.\n\n\n
@\n\n\n
So, it really is hopeless@\n\n\n
@I wish I hadn't been born a princess.\n\n\n
@No, no! I can't let myself get depressed.\nSince I've come all this way to see Ren, I must\ngreet him with a cheerful, smiling face.\n
Right! Smile, Elza!\nThere's no use worrying about things that can't\nbe changed.\n
Because I am me, after all.\n\n\n
@\n\n\n
@Ronixis sure is running late.\n\n\n
Kekekeke@\n\n\n
Eek! A m-monster@!?\n\n\n
Kekekeke@\n\n\n
N-no@!\nD-don't come near me@!\n\n
S-someone@ save me@@\nRen@!!\n\n
Elza!!\n\n\n
R-Ren@!\n\n\n
Are you okay?\n@Wait, what are you even doing here?\n\n
@Ren, thank goodness@\nI@ I@@.\n\n
Jeez@\nYour habit of getting into trouble hasn't changed.\n\n
Here. Stand up.\n\n\n
@\n\n\n
What's wrong?\n\n\n
@I can't get up.\n\n\n
@Huh?\n\n\n
I don't have the strength@\n\n\n
@*Sigh*.\n\n\n
@Here.\n\n\n
@Eh?\n\n\n
Get on my back.\n\n\n
Is that okay?\n\n\n
I can't exactly leave you here, can I?\n@This is part of my job too.\n
@Thank you.\n@Here goes@.\n\n
Ngh. @You're unexpectedly heav--\n\n\n
Say any more and I'll hit you!\n\n\n
@You already did.\n\n\n
Hehehe@\n\n\n
@What?\n\n\n
Eh, you don't remember?\nThis has happened before, you know?\n\n
Is that right?\n\n\n
It did! Let me think@ it was when I was caught in\na fight with some man I didn't know in the castle\ntown, and you came to save me.\n
That time I was asked to escort you shopping,\nhuh@?\n\n
@Come to think of it, you were too faint to stand\nback then as well.\n\n
@T-that's because it was really frightening.\n\n\n
But you said something to me back then@\n\n\n
@ÅgI will protect you.Åh\n\n\n
With that simple statement, I felt so reassured.\n\n\n
@I said that?\n\n\n
You did.\n\n\n
Well, not that I remember.\n\n\n
GrrÅ` @You're just going to play it cool again@?\nYou're always like that.\n\n
Which reminds me@ There was something I forgot to\nask you that time.\n\n
Something you wanted to ask?\n\n\n
Yes. @This is the second time you've come to my\nrescue now, but@\n\n
Why did you help me?\n@Just because it's your job?\n\n
@\n\n\n
Hey@ answer me@\n\n\n
Lady Elza!\nI went to speak to the guild but@ Wh-- Ren!?\n\n
Oh, Captain.\n\n\n
@You have the worst timing.\n\n\n
Hm? Did you say something?\n\n\n
It was nothing@\n\n\n
So, what are you doing here, and why is Lady Elza\non your back?\n\n
I'm the one who should be asking you what you're\ndoing here.\n\n
But more importantly, Captain, why did you leave\nElza alone whilst you wandered off?\n\n
ÅÑRen told Ronixis about how Elza had been\nÅ@attacked by a monster.\n
W-what did you say@ A monster!?\nL-l-l-l-lady Elza! A-a-are you hurt--!?\n\n
I'm fine. My legs were just paralysed by the\nshock. I'm not injured anywhere.\n\n
I-I am glad to hear that.\n\n\n
Save it.\nYou're the one who brought her here@\n\n
It's just good that I happened to be passing by\nwhen I did@\n\n
Yes@ It was most reckless of me.\nI'm sorry, Ren.\n\n
And Lady Elza, please forgive me@ \n\n\n
I-I really am fine, so don't look so glum. Okay?\n\n\n
Still@ I don't know what you came here for, but\nwouldn't it be better to take Elza home as soon\nas possible?\n
You're right. It will be getting dark soon.\nWe should head back.\n\n
Eh? We're leaving already?\n\n\n
You've only just escaped from danger, you really\nought to take it easy@\n\n
@Alright.\n\n\n
Ren, I'll be waiting for you at the castle, so the\nnext time you're back, you must drop by.\nPromise me!\n
@Lady Elza@\n\n\n
@Ah--\n\n\n
Fine, I've got it, so go home already.\n\n\n
And Captain, you're an old man already, so don't\noverdo it.\n\n
Nck! I'm going to pretend I didn't just hear that.\n\n\n
@Honestly! I'm going on ahead.\n\n\n
W-w-wait for me!\n\n\n
@What did those two even come here for?\n\n\n
Phew@\nIt feels like it's been a really long time since I\nlast saw daylight.\n
But, never in my wildest dreams would I have\nguessed there were such beasts with three heads.\n\n
That has to be@ the result of the Magicite.\n\n\n
Meaning there's a high chance that the stone is\nresting within the ruins.\n\n
I'm also curious about the ÅeNation of Reville' in\nthe book that Veres found@\n\n
@Guess I should return to Kucellbull Castle and\nreport on what's been going on.\n\n
As for Veres@\n\n\n
@Better to just drop it.\n\n\n
Ren of the Duchy Knights calling.\nI have returned.\n\n
Oh? Welcome back.\n\n\n
And how fares the ruins investigation?\nIs all going well?\n\n
There hasn't been that much progress as of yet,\nbut@\n\n
ÅÑRen spoke of his encounter with the huge three\nÅ@headed beast, and the effect of the Magicite.\n\n
@I see. It's true that I've only ever heard of\nthree headed beasts and the ilk as the subject\nof fairy tales.\n
Which you mean to say, was the result of the\nMagicite, and given that the giant beast exists,\nthe Magicite must also exist somewhere@?\n
Yes. And, there is one more thing.\n\n\n
Is Your Highness familiar with the nation known\nas ÅeReville'?\n\n
The Nation of Reville? I haven't heard the name@\nAre you saying they have something to do with\nthe Magicite?\n
I'm not sure it they have anything to do with\nthe stone, but@\n\n
Apparently, they're a people with a deep\nconnection to the ancient ruins.\n\n
There was a description to that nature in a\nbook that Veres, who I was sent to investigate\nwith, found in the ruins@\n
Hm. It is certainly curious@\nYou have uncovered more than we expected.\n\n
Further investigation of the ruins should reveal\nmore details about this ÅeNation of Reville'.\n\n
Return to the ruins and continue investigating\nat once. Understood?\n\n
Sire!\n\n\n
ÅÑAfter finishing his report, Ren left the Archduke\nÅ@and made ready to leave for Liruka.\n\n
Right then, I suppose I should get going@\n\n\n
Wait, Ren!\n\n\n
You know@ If you're back, you should at least\ncome and say hi!\n\n
O-oi@ There's no need to be so loud.\n\n\n
Don't forget the difference in our standings.\nEven just talking is--\n\n
That kind of thing doesn't matter.\n\n\n
@@\n\n\n
It's not like everyone in the castle doesn't\nalready know, right?\n\n
@It just means more trouble for me, though.\n\n\n
Ah! What a horrible thing to say!\n\n\n
It's the truth.\n\n\n
You really have no manners.\n\n\n
@I was worried, you know.\n\n\n
It's work. I don't have much choice.\n\n\n
Heartless as ever, I see.\n\n\n
Well, even if things get a little dangerous, when\nRen and I are together, it's pretty much child's\nplay. Right?\n
Don't lump me together with you.\n\n\n
Honestly, you get carried away so easily@\n@Wait, Veres--!? When did you get here!?\n\n
Heh heh. I thought I should come and show my\nface so I wouldn't worry you, Lady Elza.\n\n
@Don't just pop up out of nowhere.\n\n\n
Hah? Did you say something?\n\n\n
No, nothing.\n\n\n
Hehe@\n\n\n
Come to think of it, what was that other matter\nyou had to take care of in the end?\n\n
Other matter? What are you on about?\nDid I say something like that?\n\n
@\n\n\n
WoahÅ` Ren dear, that's a scary face you're\nmaking. If the wind changes, your face might\nget stuck like that, y'kno?\n
Why you-- Treating me like I'm some kid@\n\n\n
Hehehe@ Ahahahahaha!\n\n\n
Elza?\n\n\n
Did we@ break Elza@?\n\n\n
AaaahÅ`@\nWe haven't had a chance to talk like this with\njust the three of us lately, have we?\n
That's why it just made me happy.\n\n\n
Right? Right?\nAs I thought it's just hopeless when I'm not\naround, ain't it?\n
Yes. And Ren too, of course.\n\n\n
@\n\n\n
@I think it's always like this with the three of\nus, but@\n\n
@when I think about it, the two of you really\nhaven't changed at all since we first met.\n\n
I just wanted to go for a little stroll around\nthe castle@\n\n
That's not a stroll.\nIt's called an escape attempt.\n\n
You don't have to spell it out!\n\n\n
Back then, me and Ren were walking around the\ncastle's courtyard on patrol.\n\n
@Right. And then we saw this shabby-looking girl@\n\n
You could have done without the Åeshabby' part!\n@Well, not that I can deny it.\n\n
So, we never could've guessed that her highness\nwould be looking like that, and we got the wrong\nidea thinking you were up to something fishy.\n
You did!\nThe two of you were so rude, even I got a bit\nworked up and argued.\n
But in the middle of that, Ren wanted to take me\naway and Veres, you insisted on taking me back to\nyour room instead, so the two of you fought@\n
The other knights heard the noise and came\nrushing@\n@and we got into a whole load of trouble.\n
Yeah@ I practically had my ears chewed off\nafter that@\nAnd we didn't even do anything wrong@\n
So trying to take Elza to your room was@?\n\n\n
No, that was@ Right!\nThat was cuz I wanted to take my time to question\nher about why she was out there and--\n
@Not that it really matters anymore.\n\n\n
That was the first time I'd ever raised my voice\nso much, and also the first time anyone had ever\nbeen so rude to me.\n
@Thinking about how friendly we are now justÅ`Å`\nJust made me kinda happy.\n\n
So much time has passed since then but, here you\nare, quarrelling over something trivial again@\nYou really haven't changed.\n
Haven't changed, huh@?\n\n\n
That's right@ Nothing's changed.\nSince then, nothing has@\n\n
Something wrong?\n\n\n
Ah-- No, it's nothing.\n\n\n
Oh? If it isn't Ren and Veres.\n\n\n
Captain! Long time no see.\n\n\n
When did you get back?\n@Wait, now's not the time for all that.\n\n
Lady Elza. The Archduke is calling for you.\nPlease return as soon as possible.\n\n
Father is@?\n\n\n
Yes. Well, I have somewhere else I need to be, so\nLady Elza, if you please@\n\n
@I stayed longer than I meant to myself.\nI should be getting back soon.\n\n
Yes, I had better go too.\n\n\n
Ah, but the next time you're back, you have\nto come and talk with me properly. Alright?\n\n
If I feel like it.\n\n\n
@Honestly!\n\n\n
Then@ be safe, both of you.\n\n\n
ÅÑWalking away slowly, as if she didn't want to\nÅ@say goodbye, Elza took her leave.\nÅ@\n
Right, let's go.\n\n\n
Oh, I still have a bit more to do here, so go ahead\nand push on with the search without me.\n\n
@That other thing of yours, huh?\nCan't you at least tell me what it's about?\n\n
AhÅ` @W-well another time, yeah?\nI'll catch up with you at the ruins later!\n\n
@No matter.\n\n\n
For now, I should focus on my own job and finish\nthe rest of the investigation.\n\n
First off, I guess I should drop by the guild@\n\n\n
@\n\n\n
Veres!? You're back from the ruins?\n\n\n
@Yes.\n\n\n
Hm? It's not like you to be so withdrawn.\n\n\n
Well, the Archduke is waiting.\nGive him your report.\n\n
ÅÑVeres nodded and made his way to the audience\nÅ@chamber.\n\n
Oh, if it isn't Veres?\nIt seems you made it back safely.\n\n
Sire.\n\n\n
@Well, did you obtain the stone?\n\n\n
Yes. I have it@\n\n\n
Marvellous!\nHurry, let me see it.\n\n
Here. Feast your eyes.\n\n\n
ÅÑVeres opened his hands wide, presenting his body\nÅ@to the Archduke.\n\n
@What is the meaning of this?\nDon't you have the stone on you?\n\n
If you would look here.\n@This is the power of the Magicite.\n\n
Wha--!? T-this is--!?\n\n\n
ÅÑVeres' body lit up brightly.\n\n
ÅÑOn that signal, the castle gave a large groan\nÅ@and started to collapse.\n\n
W-what!? What's going on!?\nVeres! What have you done!?\n\n
I just told you, didn't I?\nThis is the power of the Magicite.\n\n
I-it can't be@\nDid you absorb it into your body!?\n\n
I only did what you were planning to do.\n\n\n
@In other words, you're no longer required.\n\n\n
Y-you wretch--!\n\n\n
ÅÑVeres reached out a hand towards the Archduke.\nÅ@With that act alone, the Archduke Kucellbull\nÅ@foresaw his death.\n
Don't------!!!!\n\n\n
@Don't worry. I'll take good care of this country.\n\n\n
ÅÑStood before the Archduke's lifeless body,\nÅ@Veres smiled quietly.\n\n
W-what in the@\nVeres, you--!!\n\n
You took great care of me over these years.\nBut, that too ends today.\n\n
The wine I wanted to drink with you one day@\nOnly that, I regret a little@\n\n
Guah--!!\n\n\n
ÅÑRonixis, who had readied his sword to stand up\nÅ@to Veres, met with his cruel fate before even\nÅ@getting a chance to use it.\n
ÅÑ@Looking at the two men lying on the floor,\nÅ@Veres gave a short sigh.\n\n
Now then, next is@\n\n\n
ÅÑAfter reconfirming the plan in his mind, just as\nÅ@Veres was about to move, a slow creak came\nÅ@from the door@\n
Veres! What are you doing!?\n\n\n
Well well, Princess Elza.\nComing here all by yourself@ You've saved me the\ntrouble of looking for you.\n
Stop fooling around! What on earth--?\n\n\n
@F-father!?\n\n\n
ÅÑNoticing the Archduke's body lying at Veres'\nÅ@feet, Elza fell to her knees@\n\n
Your father has breathed his last. @Just now, in\nfact.\n\n
ÅÑVeres made his way towards Elza, one step at a\nÅ@time@\n\n
But, it's okay.\nI'm going to be with you from now on.\n\n
So, you won't be lonely.\n\n\n
Veres@ No, were you the one who--!?\n\n\n
With this power@ I will forge a new coun@try@\n\n\n
N@ngh@\n\n\n
ÅÑVeres suddenly clasped his head and began\nÅ@to writhe in agony.\n\n
ÅÑBesides him, Elza was still struggling to\nÅ@comprehend the situation.\n\n
What happened, Veres!?\nAre you@ really Veres!?\n\n
*@Pant, pant*.\nI-it's okay, Elza. Don't worry.\n\n
I, I@ As if I'm going to let myself be completely\ntaken over by some stone--!\n\n
Stone@?\n\n
ÅÑAs she stared at him quizzically, Veres picked\nÅ@Elza up with one hand.\n\n
Aaaaagh!\nW-wait, Veres! Put me down!\n\n
It's okay@ Everything's okay@\n\n\n
Wha@ It's not okay!\nThis situation@ Father@ Fatheeeeer!!\n\n
Let's go together, to the new world I will build.\n\n\n
ÅÑCarrying Elza over his shoulder, Veres once\nÅ@again disappeared, the same way he had in the\nÅ@ruins@\n
Lady@ Elza@\n\n\n
ÅÑA few hours after Veres had left@\n\n\n
@This is--!?\n\n\n
ÅÑThe once beautiful Kucellbull Castle@\n\n\n
ÅÑWalls had collapsed, burying those inside@\nÅ@That sight, which was truly the image of hell\nÅ@itself, pierced through Ren's heart.\n
ÅÑThe world as he knew it had been completely\nÅ@destroyed, leaving him stood frozen, unable to\nÅ@move@\n
ÅÑJust then, a faint voice echoed from the back\nÅ@of the room.\n\n
@Ren@ Ren, i-is that you@?\n\n\n
@!?\n\n\n
Captain Ronixis!?\nWhat the@\n\n
I-it seems@ You are still sane@\n\n\n
I@?\n\n\n
It can't be, Veres--!?\n\n\n
@You might not believe it, but this was all his\ndoing@\n\n
I tried to stop him but@ He got me first@\n\n\n
@I don't know what happened in the ruins, but@\nthat's not the Veres we knew any more@\n\n
@No, maybe he was no longer human from the\nstart@\n\n
Not human@?\n\n\n
G@Go, Ren@ You have to stop him@\n\n\n
Captain Ronixis@\n\n\n
Princess@ Elza is@ in troub@le@\n\n\n
Cap@tain@?\n\n\n
ÅÑIn Ren's arms, Ronixis quietly breathed his last@\n\n\n
ÅÑ@Ren held back his tears. He knew that now\nÅ@wasn't the time.\n\n
Back in the ruins, he said Ågthis place shall be\nour castle"@\n\n
@Elza!!\n\n\n
ÅÑLeaving the castle behind him, Ren set off for\nÅ@the ruins once again.\n\n
*Sigh@*\nThat was pretty exhausting.\n\n
A three-headed beast, a giant sand snake, and@\ndragons@\n\n
It's enough to make anyone lose their mind.\n\n\n
And there's also the matter of the Magicite\nfragment@ I guess I should head back to\nKucellbull Castle for the time being.\n
ÅÑDespite the weariness slipping in and out of his\nÅ@bones, Ren made his way back to the castle with\nÅ@speed.\n
Ren of the Duchy Knights calling.\nI have returned.\n\n
Oh it's you, Ren?\n\n\n
Well, has there been any progress?\n\n\n
As a matter of fact@\n\n\n
ÅÑRen told the Archduke of the nation of Reville\nÅ@who created the Magicite@\n
ÅÑThe sand snake who had grown larger than ever\nÅ@thought possible, the dragons of dark green,\nÅ@gold and crimson@\n
ÅÑAnd the fragment of Magicite that Veres had\nÅ@shown him deep within the second layer of the\nÅ@ruins.\n
@A fragment of Magicite, hm?\n\n\n
But Veres said the fragment doesn't have the\ninherent power of the stone, correct?\n\n
Yes@\n\n\n
ÅÑRen hadn't mentioned the changes he'd felt\nÅ@after touching the fragment.\n\n
ÅÑAfter all, even he wasn't sure whether that\nÅ@phenomenon had been caused by the power of\nÅ@the stone@\n
But as you say, the fact that a fragment remains,\nmeans the possibility of a perfect piece of Magicite\nexisting is becoming more and more likely.\n
Hm@ Very good.\nThe day when I can make that power my own draws\nnearer@\n
@?\n\n\n
Well, it may be the final stage of the ruins\ninvestigation, but focus more than ever and\ndeliver the Magicite without fail.\n
Understood?\n\n\n
Sire!\n\n\n
ÅÑAfter finishing his general report Ren came to\nÅ@a stop, with a face that looked lost in thought.\n\n
@It doesn't really matter to me what that guy\ngets up to.\n
But if it goes against the Archduke's orders,\nthen I'll have to put a stop to it, even if it\nmeans using force.\n
ÅÑVeres' actions inside the ruins still weighed on\nÅ@his mind@\n
Oh, if it isn't Ren!\n\n\n
Captain@\n\n\n
Don't tell me you were just planning to report\nto the Archduke and head off again, were you?\n\n
That was the idea@\n\n\n
Can't you have a little more concern for other\npeople's feelings?\n\n
It's not like even I don't worry about you guys,\nyou know?\n\n
No matter how worried you are, it won't change\nthe fact that I have to leave for the ruins.\n\n
And, though it is certainly a strange place, it's\nnot a mission that puts me under any more strain\nthan normal.\n
@That's not the problem here.\n\n\n
Speaking of, what happened to Veres?\nHe's not with you?\n\n
He said he had a different matter to investigate.\n\n\n
Something else?\n\n\n
I've tried asking, but he always dodges the\nquestion@ I don't know what it's about, but@\nit seemed to be important.\n
I see. That's rare.\n\n\n
Rare?\n\n\n
From the day you both joined the knights, you've\nnearly always been together.\n\n
Training, fighting, and even your room is shared.\n\n\n
It's not like we were particularly trying to stick\ntogether.\n\n
But it's not that you hate it, right?\n\n\n
Do you remember? That night when you branded\nLady Elza as suspicious@\n\n
Yeah. You mean when, after shouting at us innocent\nvictims, this guy old enough to know better told us\na sad story about his hobby of drinking alone?\n
@That's what I meant, but show a little more\nrespect for your boss.\n\n
We made a promise back then, remember?\nThat when you came of age, the three of us would\ndrink together.\n
@You're still not of age, yet you two came to be\nentrusted with a mission like this.\n\n
Once it's all been settled@\n\n\n
I don't drink.\n\n\n
At least have one!\n\n\n
We've been together ever since then, right?\n\n\n
Since I've been watching over you all this time,\nwhen I see you going off fulfilling your duties by\nyourselves, it makes me happy, and a bit lonely.\n
@You sound like an old man.\n\n\n
Hahaha. Our ages aren't that far apart, but\nsomehow I feel like a father raising a son.\n\n
Even if you are a pain, I still want to be there.\nThe two of you are precious to me.\n\n
If you see Veres, pass that on for me.\nWell then, until next time.\n\n
@Sons, huh?\n\n\n
ÅÑAfter talking with the captain, Ren headed for\nÅ@the gate, ready to leave the castle.\n\n
ÅÑBut when he got there, he found a girl blocking\nÅ@the path.\n\n
@\n\n\n
@H-hey.\n\n\n
Again@\n\n\n
@?\n\n\n
You were about to break your promise and leave\nagain, weren't you?\n\n
Ah-- No@\n\n\n
Honestly@ You really don't think about me.\n\n\n
@\n\n\n
I do. Protecting the dukedom's princess is one of\na knight's jobs.\n\n
Just like how making progress on the investigation\nis proper work. The Archduke has been urging us\non, too.\n
Right, right. Of course.\n\n\n
@\n\n\n
@Ah, speaking of which, have you seen Veres?\n\n\n
Veres? No, I've been here alone this whole time.\n@Did something happen to him?\n\n
I saw him in the courtyard not long ago.\n\n\n
He seemed to be mumbling to himself about\nsomething at first@ So, I went to talk with him.\n\n
And then@ how should I put this@\nSomething seemed different than usual.\n\n
It's hard to explain, but@ like Veres was not\nquite Veres?\n\n
@I don't follow.\n\n\n
Mmm@ Anyway, there was something off about his\nmanner.\n\n
I thought you might know something@\n\n\n
That guy's always been weird, you know.\n\n\n
@If Veres hears you say that, he'll cry.\n\n\n
Oh, right!\nSay, could you face the other way a second?\n\n
The other way?\n\n\n
Yes, behind you.\nStand here with your back to me.\n\n
Why?\n\n\n
Never mind that, turn around!\n\n\n
Here, this is for you.\n\n\n
A necklace@?\n\n\n
I thought it might suit you.\n\n\n
And it's supposed to protect whoever wears it.\n\n\n
So it's perfect for you always visiting dangerous\nplaces, right?\n\n
I told you, you worry too much@\n\n\n
It's fineÅ` It's not like it can do any harm.\n\n\n
That's not the point.\n\n\n
It's precisely the point.\n\n\n
@I'm worried about Veres too.\nPlease@ Promise me you won't overdo it.\n\n
@\n\n\n
@Okay?\n@Please.\n\n
@I can't promise anything.\n\n\n
Why not?\n\n\n
I serve the duchy.\n\n\n
If it's an order from the Archduke, I must accept\nthe mission even if it puts my life in danger.\n\n
That's the job.\n\n\n
That's why, I might end up having to do reckless\nthings, or @I might not return one day.\n\n
And, we're talking princesses and knights.\nI can't just go about making thoughtless promises.\n\n
@Nor do I want to.\n\n\n
@\n\n\n
@Right@\n\n\n
I'm a princess, and you're a knight.\nThat will never change.\n\n
@I should be heading back soon.\n\n\n
Ah, I ought to go too.\n\n\n
Right. Well@ do be careful.\n\n\n
@I'm sorry.\n\n\n
@\n\n\n
@Well then, guess I should head back to the\nruins. I'm worried about Veres@\n\n
I dodged the issue with Elza but, there's definitely\nsomething funny going on with him.\n\n
@Probably since he first got his hands on that\nstone fragment.\n\n
@\n\n\n
I'd better find him, and fast@\n\n\n
ÅÑRen once again left Kucellbull Castle, and made\nÅ@his way for Liruka Village.\n\n
Now then@\n\n
Should I start with exploring the ruins?\n\n\n
Purrrrease waitÅ`!\n\n\n
@What--?\n\n\n
Hello hello hello!\nHave you been well?\n\n
Avanc?\n\n\n
What's wrong? Calling me out in such a panic@\n\n\n
Delivery for Ren!\nI came to give you this!\n\n
Now now now!\nHurrry up and open it!\n\n
A key for the ruins? Why give it to me?\n\n\n
I don't know.\n\n\n
I just bumped into a man with long chestnut-\ncoloured hair who asked me to give it you\nwheneverrr I next saw you.\n
(@Long chestnut-coloured hair? Does he mean\n Veres?)\n\n
Did he say anything else?\n\n\n
That was it.\n\n\n
@I see. Well, thank you.\n\n\n
That is to say@\n\n\n
I n   e x c h a n g eÅ`!\n\n\n
Make surrre you stop by Avanc's Item Shop next\ntime you need something!\n\n
There are all sorrrts of items waiting for youÅ`!\n\n\n
@I don't know what Veres is thinking, but@\n\n\n
Now that I have this key, I should be able to go\ndeeper into the ruins.\n\n
@Okay, guess it's back to work.\n\n\n
