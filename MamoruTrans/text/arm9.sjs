Roughly one thousand years ago...
There was an era of tremendous\nprosperity and great glory,\nbrought about by the power of the\ngMagiciteh, a stone created by\nhighly-developed alchemy.
The legendary civilization said\nto have been destroyed in a single\nnight... Edenbar.
By absorbing the forces of nature,\nsuch as efire', ewater', eearth' and\neair', the gMagiciteh that\nsustained the Edenbar civilization\nwas able to exert massive influence\nat will, a tainted power that\ntrespassed on God's domain.
The people, acting out of self-\ninterest, abused the power without\nany consideration of the effect\nthat it would have on the world.
As a result, the balance of the\nnatural world crumbled. Having gone\ntoo far, the civilisation was left\nwith no other path than to its ruin.
And, in the present day...
We've received all sorts of requests from the\nvillagers, traders and hunter's association.
Come back once you've completed a quest.
You aren't currently on any quests, so there's\nnothing to see here.
Oh? Leaving so soon?
You can't take on two requests at the same time.\nFinish your current quest first.
You can abandon your current quest, but note\nthat the contract fee you paid won't be returned.\n
This quest is to assess your abilities as a new\nhunter.\nPlease see it through to the end.
You can report that you've finished a request at\nthe reception desk.\nDrop by any time.

Strange... There's a fire here.\n\n\nDid someone abandon their bonfire...?\n\n\n
„Having found a blazing fire, Ren slowly drew\n@closer to warm his cold body.\n\n
It's unexpectedly cold in these ruins...\nThis thing's a lifesaver.\n\n

N...no, it really can move!?\n\n\n
*Yaa`aawn*\n...That was a good nap.\n\n
!?\n\n\n
Hmm? Who are you?\nIt's dangerous to be alone in a place like this,\nyou know.\n
The skeleton... spoke...?\n\n\n
Oh, right, right.\n\n\nIt's been so long since I last saw anyone, I\ncompletely forgot that I'd become like this.\nHahaha!\n
Ha, haah...\n\n\n
So, what on earth are you doing in a place like\nthis?\n\n
W-well, a woman named Anna from Liruka village put\nin a request at the guild...\n\n
„Ren told the talking skeleton that he had come\n@to find <C03>Anna<C04>'s husband, an archaeologist, on her\n@request.\n„The skeleton seemed to listen carefully, not\n@moving an inch.\n\n
...So, that's my story.\n\n\n
...I see.\n\n\n
You've been down here a long time, right?\nHave you seen anyone who seems to fit?\n\n
Well, she probably means me.\n\n\n
Wha--!?\n\n\n
I mean it.\nEven though I look like this, I'm an archaeologist.\n\nI discovered this site a few years ago and snuck\nin here on my own to investigate.\n\nAnd as a result, the mummy-hunter became the\nmummy, or skeleton... you get the drift.\n\nHa ha ha haa--\n*Cough, cough*!\n\nOh, pardon me. Even though this body is hollow,\nit's easy for things to get caught. Dearie me...\n\n
Er... So, what you're saying is...\n\n\n
Right. It's exactly what it looks like; I'm already\ndead.\n\nIt seems the power left here by the ancient\npeople still persists to this day...\n\nNot realising that, I was driven on by curiosity,\nand, thanks to an onslaught of hidden monsters,\nsaid my goodbyes to this world.\nBut strangely, even though I died, my soul didn't\nleave my bones, thus I got a body that will never\nrot.\n...However, itfs all down to the power of a most\ncurious stone called Magicite that fills these ruins.\n\nIf I take one step outside of this place, I might\nnever move again.\n\nBut, well I don't let it get me down. Thanks to\nthis, I can investigate the ruins without having\nto worry about time.\nHa ha ha haa--\n*Cough, cough*!\n\n......\n\n\n...Ifve done such an awful thing to my wife...\n\n\n
...\n\n\n
Still, I'm doing fine, despite being dead and all.\n\n\nI'm sorry to have to ask this, but could you let\nmy wife know what happened?\n\n
Yeah, I'll tell her.\n\n\n
Thank you.\nWell, do be careful on the way.\n\n
You too, keep well.\n\n\n
I'm always well!\n\n\nOr, as well as a dead guy can be. Ha ha ha haa--\n*Cough, cough*!\n\n
Then, I'll take my leave.\n\n\n
...A human?\nAye yai yai... They can make it this far in...\n\n
...A goblin?\n\n\n
Shut your face! Hurry up and shove off already!\nIf you donft, Ifll have to use my bow and arrow...\n\n
...Come again?\n\n\n
Do you want to become Swiss cheese!?\n\n\n
O-oi! H-hold up!\nI'm here because I've got business with you!\n\n
I donft want anything to do with the likes of you.\n\n\n
Would you just put that thing down for a second\nand listen to me!?\n\n
„Raising his voice, Ren expressed his desire for\n@the Kobold to hear him out.\n\n„Sensing the seriousness, the Kobold lowered its\n@bow.\n\n
...So, what gbusinessh could a human like you\npossibly have with me?\n\n
Heh... So you finally feel like listening?\n\n\n
Nevermind that, out with it already!\n\n\n
R-right...\n\n\n
„The commission from a man named <C03>Roy<C04> who was\n@saved by a Kobold whilst investigating the ruins...\n\n„And the letter he had been entrusted with\n@containing those unspoken feelings of gratitude...\n\n„Ren spoke with a cool voice as he explained the\n@situation to the Kobold.\n\n
...So, being a Kobold yourself, I wanted your help\nto find this Kobold who went out of his way to\nsave a human...\n
...Why should I do something like that?\n\n\nBesides... For monsters like me, it doesn't exactly\nmake us happy to receive thanks from a human.\n\nGetting a letter like that would just be revolting.\n\n\nMore likely, that Kobold you say was trying to help\nthis Roy, was actually just trying to steal his\nstuff.\n
„As he said those cold words, a hint of loneliness\n@could be seen on the Kobold's face.\n\n
...That's a twisted way of seeing things.\n\n\n
Roy really was grateful.\n\n\nIf he hadn't been rescued when he was, he would\nhave died there, trapped in the depths of the\nruins.\nAnd for the Kobold, carrying Roy all the way to\nthe surface risked attack by both ferocious\nbeasts and humans...\nBut despite the danger, he decided to help.\n\n\nThat Kobold, at the very least, couldn't have been\nas twisted as you.\nI don't know how you could look at them...\nRoy, so truly grateful for the help, or the Kobold\nwho crossed the barrier of species to lend out his\nhand, and still say such things.\n
„Each word he said without even taking a pause\n@for breath struck the Kobold at its core.\n\n„Seeming to have resigned himself, the Kobold\n@suddenly let out a long sigh and raised its head.\n\n
Good grief...\n...Alright, fine.\n\nHand over that letter. I'll see to it that it gets\ndelivered.\n\n
You mean it!?\n\n\n
Yeah. Kobolds don't tell lies.\n\n\n
Ah, sorry.\nThen I'm counting on you.\n\n
„Ren handed over the letter that the Guild had\n@entrusted him with.\n\n
Oh... right...\n\n\n
Hm? What is it?\n\n\n
M-mm... Well... Roy...\n\n\nPass this message on to that human, Roy.\n\n\ngDon't ever come back to the ruins! Even if you\nget hurt, I'm not gonna help you!h\n\n
Wha...?\n\n\n
„As if trying to have the final say, the Kobold\n@disappeared from sight.\n\n„The Kobold's awkward tenderness left Ren with a\n@small fuzzy feeling in his chest.\n\n
Mur!\n\n\n
...Hm?\n\n\n
Whatcha doing here, mur??\n\n\n
...You're awfully chatty.\n\n\n
I received a request about a Murmur who was\ntreated badly by humans in the past...\n\n
But even if it didn't come to hate humans, there's\nno way it'd be this friendly, right?\n\n
Mur??\nWhatcha muttering about, mur??\n\n
Er...\n(...Maybe I should still ask, just in case?)\n\n
Have you ever been to a village where humans live?\n\n\n
Where humans live...\n\n\n
...Mur been.\n\n\n
Really!?\n\n\n
...Are you gonna get mad with mur?\n...Are you gonna throw rocks at mur again?\n\n
...Throw rocks?\n\n\n
Long ago, mur went to a village full of humans\nbecause mur wanted to be friends with them.\n\n
And then, everyone started shouting and throwing\nrocks at mur.\n\n
Mur got scared and ran away, mur...\n\n\n
Did everyone get mad because mur went to a human\nplace?\n\n
...No, that's not it.\n\n\n
At that time, they were probably surprised that a\nmonster suddenly entered the village.\n\n
Some monsters are friendly like you, but there are\nstill a lot of them who attack humans.\n\n
So, when they saw you, I guess they misunderstood\nand thought you were going to attack.\n\n
Mur wouldn't do something like that, mur!\nMur just wanted to get along...\n\n
It's okay. There are some humans who want to get\nto know you too.\n\n
...When you were being driven away from village,\nthere was a woman there named <C03>Viola<C04>.\n\n
She wants to meet you and apologise.\nYou should go and make friends.\n\n
Really, mur?\nReally, really, mur?\n\n
Yeah. I was hired to pass along the message.\n\n\n
Well, now you know.\nGo, and be safe.\n\n
Mur!!\nMur going! Thank you, mur!\n\n
„Ren quietly watched the Mumur, as it happily\n@bounced away...\n\n
Oh, welcome.\n\n\n

This room is also rather big.\n\n\n
„Ren restlessly surveyed the room, which was so\n@large that it was impossible to see the ceiling\n@above or walls to either side.\n„It seemed that the floor to the left and right\n@had been cut off, with what appeared to be a\n@sheer drop surrounding the area.\n„There was no way to judge where the chasm\n@shrouded in darkness might lead.\n\n„Only... that the deep darkness seemed to warn\n@that the fall would be deadly.\n\n
...The other rooms were bad enough, but this is\neven more creepy...\n\nStill, it's places like this where new discoveries lie.\n\n
...Hm? ...I hear something.\n\n\n
„Was it because of the strange atmosphere that\n@filled the room...?  Or had the thought of\n@treasure close at hand made him careless...?\n„Either way... Ren had failed to notice the\n@presence of the creature drawing ever closer...\n\n
Rooooooaaar!!\n\n\n
A d...dragon!?\n\n\n
...Why have you come here?\n\n\n
...!?\n\n\n
„The giant dragon that had appeared from depths\n@of the darkness just stared at Ren...\n\n„...and asked a question with a low voice that was\n@both quiet and intimidating.\n\n
............\n\n\n
„Ren didn't answer.\n\n\n„No... To be precise, he couldn't answer.\n\n\n„Perhaps overwhelmed by the sudden appearance\n@of he dragon, he found himself unable to move\n@an inch.\n
Answer me. What business have you here?\n\n\n
...Ifm investigating these ruins.\n\n\n
...A thief, then.\n\n\n
I am the <C03>Guardian<C04> of these ruins. I am bound to\nthis place, burdened with the task of protecting\nit...\n...Are you so foolish that you can't understand my\nwords?\n\n
„The tone of the dragon who was speaking quietly\n@had changed slightly.\n\n„Ren who had been listening in silence, noticed\n@the change and came back to his senses.\n
...That life.\nI thought you had resigned yourself...\n\nIt appears I was mistaken...\n\n\n
„Ren's body, having regained the ability to move,\n@clutched at his sword without hesitation.\n\n„That wordless act in itself shot the signal fire\n@for the fight to begin.\n\n
...Here I come!!\n\n\n
...Hm? ...Oh, a child.\n\n\n
...You shouldn't hang around a place like this.\nThere's no telling what might happen.\n\n
Actually, I'm here on business today...\n\n\n
Business? With me?\n\n\n
Yeah, you know a swordsman named <C03>Bordeaux<C04>, right?\n\n\n
Bordeaux?\nAh, that greenhorn.\n\n
Greenhorn?\n\n\n
Yes, a real fool. No matter how many times I've\ndefeated him, he doesn't hesitate to challenge me.\n\n
His swordsmanship still needs a lot of work.\nHence, a greenhorn.\n\n
Though... He has potential.\n\n\n
As a human being he will naturally grow in age,\nbut he will progress in a great many other ways\ntoo.\n
So, what's the deal?\n\n\n
Ah, about the rematch you agreed to...\n\n\n
He's decided on the place and time and asked me\nto pass it on.\n\n
Hoh? I can't wait.\n\n\n
There's not much you get to look forward to when\nyou live in a place like this, after all.\n\n
No matter how many times he loses, he is still a\nfool. But, I don't hate fools like that.\n\n
Tell him that I'll be waiting.\n\n\n
Great.\n\n\n
Well, I'd best be off then.\n\n\n
A moment, if you please.\n\n\n
Hm?\n\n\n
From the looks of it, it seems like you also dabble\nin the sword. How about it?\nAre you up for some training with me?\n
Geh... You sound just like my captain.\n\n\n
A-anyway, my job here is finished, so I'm heading\nback!\n\n
See you.\n\n\n
...He appears to have much potential too.\n\n
Phew...\n\n\n
„Having finished his first quest, Ren looked\n@at the rewards he'd earnt with a satisfied\n@smile.\n
„Charnet approached him from behind the counter.\n\n\n
Good work.\nSo, now do you understand how things run from\naccepting a request to completing it?\n
As for what's next, you could continue doing\nquests, or, you could just do your own thing\nin the ruins. You're free to do as you like!\n
And, now that I've tested your skills, I'll\nleave this key for the ruins in your care.\n\n
If you can't get any further without this key,\nVeres won't be able to investigate...\n\n
Don't worry.\nI gave one to your friend earlier.\n\n
You just missed each other.\n\n\n
I see.\n\n\n
He said he had something else to look into,\nbut I wonder what it was...\n\n
Oh, one more thing. I spoke to the <C03>Blacksmith<C04> and\nthe <C03>Item Shop<C04> that we have here in Liruka Village,\nso you should pop round to see them.\n
You'll be needing their help for the road ahead,\nand you might be able to ask them for some advice\nabout your search too.\n
The Blacksmith and Item Shop, huh...?\nAlright. I'll pay them a visit later.\n\n
Well, good luck with your investigation.\nI'll be cheering you on from behind.\n\n
„And with that, Charnet went back to the\n@other person she was helping.\n\n
„Ren looked at his rewards again.\n\n
...This isn't so bad, I guess.\n\n\n
„The treasure slumbering in the ancient ruins...\n@The band of monsters ready to attack...\n\n
„It was so faint that the person himself didn't\n@even notice his heart quietly throbbing...\n\n
......\n\n\n
Strange... There's a fire here.\n\n\nDid someone abandon their bonfire...?\n\n\n
„Having found a blazing fire, Ren slowly drew\n@closer to warm his cold body.\n\n
It's unexpectedly cold in these ruins...\nThis thing's a lifesaver.\n\n
„Holding both hands out to the crackling fire,\n@he surrendered his body to the warmth.\n\n„.........\n\n\n
...Umm...\n\n\n
...\n\n\n
Hello, good sir?\n\n\n
Mm... Maybe I'm imagining things?\n\n\n
No, it is no such thing.\n\n\n
Yeah, just my imagination...\n\n\n
--W-wait?! Who's there!?\n\n\n
I am right here.\n\n\n
W-where!? Show yourself!!\n\n\n
As I said, I'm right here, in front of you.\n\n\n
In front of me...? It can't be, this fire--!?\n\n\n
Indeed` You finally realised?\n\n\n
No, well... All the other fireball monsters are\nalways moving around, but you didn't move at all...\n\n
Haha, I see` Lately, I haven't been feeling too\nwell, so I decided to rest here.\n\n
I suppose my actions really have been out of\ncharacter for one such as myself.\n\n
Out of character...?\n\n\n
Were you the one who helped an archaeologist\ncalled <C03>Mizuka<C04>?\n\n
Mizuka... I don't know anyone by that name,\nalthough...\n\n
Not long ago, there was an incident where I guided\na lost woman to the exit...?\n\n
That's the one. So it was you.\n\n\n
But, why would guiding someone to the exit make\nyou get sick?\n\n
Well... It is embarrassing to admit this, but...\n\n\n
We, light-emitting beings are vulnerable to sunlight.\n\n\n
It seems I was exposed to light, be it a small\namount, as I went near the vicinity of the exit.\n\n
Ever since then, I have been resting here...\n\n\n
...I see.\n\n\n
Well, thanks to you, it seems that I will be able\nto move again soon.\n\n
...Can I ask you something?\n\n\n
By all means.\n\n\n
Why did you go out of your way to show Mizuka\nto the exit, knowing that you are vulnerable to\nlight?\n
...I could never abandon a woman in need.\n\n\n
I am a gentlemen, after all.\n\n\n
...That so?\n\n\n
Well, anyway.\nI've a message she asked me to pass on.\n\n
gThank you."\n\n\n
I only did what was right.\nI need no thanks.\n\n
Well, it's about time that I was off.\nDo take care.\n\n
...He was a pretty cool guy... for a fireball.\n\n\n

This is the Magicite, huh?\n\n\n
With this stone, I can obtain power.\nThe power to not lose, even to him...\n\n
Veres!!\n\n\n
...It figures, Ren. I didn't think you would lose,\nbut... You really do astound me.\n\n
Veres, what are you plotting?\n\n\n
Didn't we come here with the mission to take the\nstone back to the Archduke?!\n\n
You know, don't you?\n...If he gets the power of this stone, it surely\nwonft be used to do good.\n
...\n\n\n
For military use, to take over the world...\nIf the power is gonna be used for such crap...\n...I'll use it.\n
...What!?\n\n\n
„Entrusting himself to the massive piece of\n@Magicite, Veres held out his hands and embraced\n@it.\n
„A pale blue glow began to enshroud his body...\n\n\n
Stop! Veres! You saw that huge giant, right!?\nDo you want to turn into that too!?\n\n
Uooooooohhhhh!!!!!!\n\n\n
Veres!!!!\n\n\n
...\n\n\n
Y-You...\n\n\n
It's okay, Ren.\nI haven't changed.\n\n
...But, I have obtained power.\nI won't lose to you anymore.\n\n
Not at sword fighting, nor Elza...\n\n\n
Elza?\n\n\n
...Oi, Veres. What are you on about...?\n\n\n
This place shall be our castle.\nBut first... I'll start with that.\n\n
„Without another word, Veres disappeared.\n\n\n
„Ren was convinced that he had already been\n@taken in by the power of the stone.\n\n
...Elza's in danger.\n\n\n
„Ren still had no idea of what Veres was about\n@to do.\n\n
„But even so, he could tell that Elza was in\n@trouble.\n\n
Well, speaking of... About the nation of Reville in\nthat book I showed you before...\n\n
Apparently, they're the ones who used alchemy to\ncreate Magicite in the days of Edenbar, which was\ndestroyed a thousand years ago.\n
Using alchemy... to make Magicite?\n\n\n
...It's getting more and more unbelievable.\nAlchemy is the stuff of fiction, right?\n\n
But, the stone really exists.\n\n\n
...To create a miraculous stone, you need a\nmiraculous power.\n\n
There's a lot we don't know, but now you've gotta\nbelieve at least that much, right?\n\n
...I guess so.\n\n\n
So, it's said that ancient civilization's collapse\nwas due to their over-reliance on the power of\nMagicite...\n
Meaning, the gsin committed by the nation of\nRevilleh mentioned in that book is that they\ncreated the Magicite.\n
...That makes sense.\nDoes that mean this stone is that dangerous?\n
Well, it's hard to say much without seeing the real\nthing, plus, it was an order from the Archduke.\n\n
It doesn't make a difference whatever we think\nhere.\n\n
...\n\n\n
Besides, if things go well...\n...This could be a great opportunity.\n\n
Hm? Did you say something?\n\n\n
N-no, nothing.\n\n\n
I'll try to find out more about it for now, so\ngood luck with everything on your end.\n\n
H-hey! Wait a sec--\n...He never listens to a word anyone else has to\nsay, that guy.\n
„Veres left quickly, before hefd even had the\n@chance to hear Ren calling.\n\n
...\n\n\n
The Magicite was created by the nation of Reville,\nhuh...?\n\n
...\n\n\n
What..?\nMy right hand feels... off...\n\n
„Suddenly feeling something strange in his right\n@hand, Ren subconsciously drew his sword.\n\n
Somehow, I feel like I'm overflowing with more power\nthan usual...\n...What is this?\n
„Ren couldn't hide his bewilderment at the power\n@overflowing from his right hand.\n\n
„It crossed his mind that until just then, he had\n@been holding the fragment of Magicite in that\n@same  hand.\n
„If this is the power of that stone...\n\n\n
„Had Veres not noticed it... or...?\n\n\n
„Whilst running that question through his mind\n@without solution, something suddenly appeared\n@from beneath the ground.\n
Gaaaoorr----!!!\n\n\n
I-it's huge!?\nThis thing was in the sand--!?\n\n
...Damn.\nAnything really is possible in this place.\n\n
Gaaaoorr----!!!\n\n\n
...I've got no choice, huh?\n\n\n
„Determined, Ren gripped the sword tightly in his\n@hand and pointed it at the giant sand snake.\n\n
„Ren signed the request and place it next to\n@Charnet, who was busy seeing to someone else.\n\n
„Then, with perfect timing, the other visitor\n@left, and Charnet returned to check over\n@the piece of paper.\n
Perfect.@Looks like that didn't give you any\ntrouble.\n\n
Now, all you have to do is fulfil the conditions,\nand then come back here.\nPiece of cake, right?\n
Complete the request, <C03>return to the guild, and\nreport my results<C04>...\n\n
I figured as much.\n...Don't treat me like a kid.\n
Oh?@Did I hit a nerve?\n\n\n
cccc\n\n\n
Hehehe.@Sorry, sorry.\n\n\n
Ah, right.@Almost forget!\nThis is for you, since you're new here.\n\n
It's a map of the ruins.\n...Well, it's actually just a piece of paper and a\npen.\n
Anyway, as you walk around the ruins, you can\nfinish it yourself.\n\n
And, there's also a guide published by the guild\naimed at helping new treasure hunters get started.\n\n
You've got to look out for yourself.\nMake sure you have a read through it so you\ndon't end up crying and regretting it later.\n
<C05>    @ yMap of the Ruinsz<C04>\n\n When you're inside the ruins,\n a map will be displayed on the\n lower screen.\n <C03>The map will automatically\n update whenever you enter a\n new room.<C04>\n Try walking through every nook and\n cranny to complete it.
<C05>     yExploration Guidez<C04>\n\n It contains various bits of\n useful info. You can check\n the contents at any time by\n pressing the START button to\n call the <C03>menu, and then going\n to your gItemsh and choosing\n the gKeyh category.<C04>
A guide to exploring... hm.\n\n\n
As with anything, you need to have a firm grasp\nof the basics, right?\n\n
Especially when it comes to suspicious men who\nlook more like kids, wouldn't-you-say?\n\n
......\n\n\n
Well then, time for you head off to the ruins and\ncomplete that request.\n\n
Yeah, I'll have it done in no time.\n\n\n
„Peeling himself away from the counter, Ren\n@waved to Charnet and quickly made his way\n@out of the Guild.\n
Letfs see... Hmmm...\nAhh... Interesting...\n\n
What is it?\n\n\n
This book appears to date back to the ancient\ncivilisation. It seems to be about a <C03>permanent skill<C04>\nwhich allows you to perform <C03>Evasive Manoeuvres<C04>.\n
<C03>Evasive Manoeuvres<C04>?\n\n\n
Yes... To summarise it...\n\n\n
g...By curling your body into a small ball and\nrolling quickly, you'll be able to pass through\nnarrow paths with ease...\n
It can also help you to avoid enemy attacks..."\n\n
It sounds kinda weird...\n\n\n
But, if you come across somewhere where it's\ntoo narrow to walk through, or think an enemy\nis about to strike...\n
...Then it might be worth giving this <C03>evasive\nmanoeuvre<C04> thing a shot, right?\n\n
Yeah, no harm in trying.\n\n\n
<C05>@@@@@INFORMATION<C04>\n\n<C03>@yPermanent Skillsz<C04>\n@These begin to take effect\n@as soon as they're learnt.\n\n<C03>@yAssigned Skillsz<C04>\n@Once learnt, the skill must\n@be allocated to take effect.\n@(SP is required)
<C05>@@@@@INFORMATION<C04>\n\n@You can visit gSkillsh from\n@the menu to <C03>view permanent\n@skills<C04> and <C03>assign assigned\n@skills<C04>.\n\n@It's worth checking whenever\n@you learn a new skill.\n
Just like this, if you bring a book that contains\ninformation about a skill to the guild, I'll teach\nyou about it.\n
Only then will you be able to learn the skill.\n\n\n
So... in order to learn a skill, I have to <C03>bring\nthe skill book back with me from the ruins, and\ntake it here, to the guild<C04>.\n
Exactly.\n\n\n
Just remember that once you've found a book, it\nwon't be effective immediately.\n\n
Got it.\n\n\n
Still... having to go all the way back to the exit\nevery time I find a book is such a pain...\n\n
I wouldn't worry about that.\n\n\n
You might already know this, but there's a tool\nthat allows you to instantly travel from the ruins\nback to the village that you could use.\n
Since I have one spare, I'll let you have it.\nCall it a special service for newcomers.\n\n
If you need more, you can buy them at the Item\nShop...\n\n
...or, if you've got all the materials, you can make\none by mixing them together.\n\n
If I'm not mistaken, the recipe is <C03>Fascina Powder<C04>\nand... what was that other one again?\n\n
Well anyways, I think you probably still have some\nways go before you'll be ready to make that...\n\n
So for now, you'll have to buy them whilst you\nfocus on learning the basics and collecting\nmaterials.\n
Right. Thanks for your help.\n\n\n
Oh, no need to thank me.\n\n\n
...Just be sure to see to the guild's request\nlist, okay?\n\n
...Was that your motive all along?\n\n\n
Hehehe. Ifm kidding.\nWell, more like half-kidding.\n\n
Now then...\nWas there something else you wanted?\n\n
...\n\n\n
...A way to draw out that power... to the body...\nNo... But...\n\n
Veres?\nWhat are you doing here?\n\n
...Being overwhelmed by that power...\nMaybe I'm overthinking it... But, that method...\n\n
...\n\n\n
...Oi!\n\n\n
Wah!?\n--Ren!? When did you get here!?\n\n
...I've been here the whole time.\n\n\n
Popping up without a sound...\nYou're like a ghost.\n\n
...Isn't it just you who was too busy being spaced\nout?\n\n
W-well anyway, perfect timing!\n\n\n
I was actually just thinking of giving this to you.\n\n
A key for the ruins?\nWhy are you giving it to me?\n\n
There's something I want to check up, so I'm\nheading back to the castle for a bit.\n\n
That's why I thought you could use the key to do\na bit of investigating ahead of me.\n\n
...That's unusual.\n\n\n
What is?\n\n\n
Normally, you'd say something about being the\nfirst one there and keep the key with you.\n\n
...I-is that right?\n\n\n
Yeah.\n\n\n
...W-well I guess I've done a bit of growing up too.\n\n\n
Right, I'm off to the castle now, so...\nI'll leave that key to you.\n\n
Wait!\nI havenft finished talking with you--!\n\n
...What's so important that he's got to rush\nover there for?\n\n
...Still, I got a key that I can use in the ruins,\nso I guess allfs well.\n\n
<C05>@@@@@ INFORMATION<C04>\n\n yRutila Keyz<C04> obtained.\n\n Now you can advance past <C03>the\n door<C04> that was locked...\n\n You know, the one with green\n walls where a monster holding a\n club lies in ambush. That room.
Somehow... the air in here feels different to the\nprevious rooms...\n\n
„Ren, having made it deep into the first layer,\n@felt a sense of unease at the strange\n@atmosphere that had settled in the room.\n
„At that moment, footsteps could be heard coming\n@from one of the corners, and Ren put his guard\n@up.\n
...!\n\n\n
Yo.\n\n\n
Veres? ...Don't scare me like that.\n\n\n
Oops` Sorry, my bad.\nBy the way, is your search going well?\n\n
I haven't made that much progress.\n\n\n
How about you?\nThat other thing you were on about...\n\n
Huh? ...Oh, that thing.\nWell, I'm getting there, inch by inch.\n\n
But never mind that, I found something interesting.\nHave a read of this.\n\n
„Veres took out an old book and handed it to Ren.\n\n\n
...It's so dirty that it's hard to read.\nLet's see...\n\n
gWe have committed a terrible sin...\nThis stone is something that shouldn't exist...\n\n
Some people worship our nation of Reville as\nGods... but that is a mistake.\n\n
No matter how superior our skills, we are still\nonly human.\n\n
...No, we are less.\n\n\n
We tread foot into a realm that should never\nbe touched by humans...h\n\n
„Ren read aloud the page that Veres had shown\n@him.\n\n
It seems like it's a record from ancient times,\nbut...\n\n
I got the impression this eNation of Reville' it\nmentions must have been heavily intertwined\nwith these ruins.\n
The eNation of Reville', huh?\n...That's the first I've heard of them.\n\n
Well, I've got this part covered so you should get\nback to searching for the Magicite.\n\n
I'm counting on you!\n\n\n
H-hey! Veres!\n\n\n
„Without regard to the voice calling out to him,\n@Veres disappeared into another room.\n\n
.........\n\n\n
...That book certainly got my attention.\n\n\n
eThe Nation of Reville...f\nPeople worshiped them like Gods, but they had\ncommitted a huge sin...\n
...That alone has lost me.\n\n\n
„Ren, trying to wrap his head around the content\n@of the passage he just read was unaware that\n@he was making a big mistake...\n
„...having forgotten the eerie atmosphere he'd\n@first felt when entering the room, before Veres\n@had interrupted.\n
„Thatfs when...\n\n\n
Grrrrrr...\n\n\n
What the-- That thing is...\n\n\n
„Right in front of him was a ginormous beast\n@with three heads.\n\n
„It's hostility was plain for all to see.\n\n\n
I've never seen a creature like this before...\n\n\n
Is this another effect of the mysterious stone\nknown as eMagicite'?\n\n
Grrrrrr...\n\n\n
...This is no time be lost in thought!\nI've gotta do something that thing first...!\n\n
„Ren shook his head and gripped at the sword\n@at his waist...\n\n
...Phew.\n\n\n
I wonder if that's the first layer pretty much\ninvestigated now.\n\n
Oi! You there!\n\n\n
...What?\n\n\n
Yo. Is the search going well?\n\n\n
Ah, the blacksmith...\n\n\n
Um... what was it again?\n\n\n
Lagnus!!\n\n\n
Sheesh... And to think I came all this way cuz I\nhave some info for you...\n\n
...Maybe I'll just leave.\n\n\n
S-sorry. I was just kidding.\n\n\n
So... Mr Lagnus.\nWhat was the info you had for me?\n\n
Have you been having trouble gathering material?\n\n\n
...It's hard to be efficient, I guess.\n\n\n
Ainft it just?\n\n\n
Still, the grass might be the same, but did you\nknow you can pick up different items depending on\nwhere it is? ...The same goes for monsters too.\n
There are materials that can and cannot be\ncollected from monsters with the exact same name.\n\n
...In general, the higher quality materials needed\nto make stronger weapons are in the possession\nof the monsters further inside the ruins.\n
So if you want a certain material, but can't seem\nget it no matter how many you kill...\n\n
...then check to see if there any similar monsters\nelsewhere.\n\n
...That makes sense.\n\n\n
And, I have this for you.\n\n\n
Is this a key for the ruins? Why are you giving it\nto me?\n\n
A customer asked me to go to the ruins to collect\nsome material for making a sword...\n\n
...and I just happened to find it then.\n\n\n
I'm not all that interested in the depths of the\nruins, plus I have no time to go and see them.\n\nThat's why I thought I'd give it to you.\n
...I think it's better that it's used for research\nrather than going to someone who just wants to\ntry dig up treasure.\n
Wow... You really are a good guy.\n\n\n
I thought I already told you to call me eMr Lagnusf!\n\n\n
Thank you... Mr Lagnus.\n\n\n
Much better!\n\n\n
Well, I'm gonna get back.\nIf you find yourself wanting a weapon, pop round!\n\n
<C05>@@@@@INFORMATION<C04>\n\n <C03>ySapphyri Keyz<C04> obtained.\n\n Now you can advance past <C03>the\n door<C04> that was locked...\n\n Eh? Youfve forgotten about it?\n ...Come on now, the door's in\n that looong room. Remember?
...Hey. Took you long enough.\n\n\n
...?\n\n\n
„That odd room was so unlike any other, it truly\n@felt like entering a different dimension.\n\n
„And there, loitering around in such a place was\n@Veres.\n\n
„Unable to suppress the unnaturally foreign\n@feeling building up inside of him, Ren gripped a\n@hand around his sword...\n
...Huh? Why are you pointing your sword at me?\n\n\n
Are you... really Veres?\n\n\n
Hehehe...\nWhat weird stuff are you spouting?\n\n
Any way you look at it, it's me, right?\n\n
„It certainly looked like Veres, but sensing that\n@something inside him had changed, he seemed like\n@a different person to Ren's eyes.\n
„Veres' hand was wrapped tightly around a\n@fragment of Magicite.\n\n
Veres! You need to throw that stone away!\nThat stone is--!\n\n
Quiet.\n\n\n
...You see, this stone... It spoke to me...\ngPower... I'll give you power...h\n\n
This is what I have been looking for...\n...I won't let anyone get in my way.\n\n
Veres... You...\n\n\n
Ren, you might have already figured this out\nbefore you came here, but...\n\n
Not only can you use the power within the Magicite\nitself, but there is also a way draw it out.\n\n
...\n\n\n
...That is, embedding the power of the stone into\nthe human body.\n\n
Embedded with a stone, humans can obtain a power\nthat transcends even God!\n\n
But... If you can't control that power and are\nswallowed by it, you'll turn into an atrocious\nmonster...\n
By the way, the real cause of the ancient\ncivilization's collapse is that monster... The\ngancient giant" who destroyed all civilization.\n
...!?\n\n\n
But foolishly, the world the ancient giant\ndestroyed was also the source of its power,\nthe gMagicite".\n
By refusing its roots, the giant fell into a long\nslumber.\n\n
After that, the survivors of the Nation of\nReville sealed the Magicite and the giant\ndeep underground.\n
Thatfs-- These ruins..!?\n\n\n
Correct.\n\n\n
Now then... I really should be going soon.\nIt's not yet time for me to deal with you.\n\n
Sorry, but play with this guy for me, won't you?\n\n\n
„As he spoke, Veres threw the fragment of\n@Magicite he had been holding into the darkness\n@below.\n
If it were me, it would be hopeless, but...\nYou'll be able to figure something out.\nRight, Ren...?\n
„Leaving the room behind him, Veres' eyes swelled\n@with loneliness...\n
„Ren immediately tried to run after him, when he\n@heard a roar bellowing from the place where\n@the fragment of Magicite had been thrown.\n
It can't be...\n\n\n
Graaaaaaaar...!\n\n\n
Did he use the fragment of Magicite to wake the\nancient giant?\n\n
Damn it. I have to stop Veres before he does\nanything else stupid...\n\n
...But first, I'd better do something about this.\n\n\n
„The ancient giant looked around slowly, as if it\n@were trying to get a read on the situation.\n
...\n\n\n
gYou'll be able to figure something out", huh?\n...Yeah. I can handle this.\n\n
„Determined, Ren stared at the giant, many times\n@his own size.\n\n
Come on, Monster!\nI'll play with you...\n\n
„As if in response, the giant raised his huge\n@hands above is head...\n\n

Oh my my! I haven't seen your face beforre.\nArrre you new?\n\n
I've just registered with the guild, so I was\ntold to come and say hello...\n\n
Ah! So you're the new registrrree, Ren?\nI hearrrd the news.\n\n
I'm Avanc!\nNice to meet you!\n\n
Ah, likewise.\n\n\n
So, this is the item shop, right?\nIs there anyone else around?\n\n
As you see, Avanc is the only one!\nThis is Avanc's Item Shop!\n\n
Wow... Even though you're so tiny.\n\n\n
My size is irrrelevant!!\n\n\n
Besides, Avanc's shop has a reputation forrr\nhaving a wide range of stock!\n\n

A big pot?\n\n\n
Err...\n\n\n
Oh, you mean this?\n\n\n
„Ren replied, pointing at the pot that was stood\n@next to the counter.\n\n
Yes! That's the one!\n\n\n
That pot is the emixing pot'. Just add materials\nand give it a little stirrr...\n\n
...and they'll be mixed together in the lick of a\npaw, giving you a new item or piece of equipment.\nA truly marrrvelous invention!\n
Wow` That does sound handy.\n...But I'm a bit scared that you haven't brought\nup anything about a charge to use it.\n
Non, non, non!\nTherrre is nothing to be scared of!\n\n

Well well well, what would you like?\n\n\n
„The Adventure's Guild, Liruka Village Branch.\n\n\n„It seemed to have become a base for those\n@who were exploring the ruins, as it was packed\n@full despite being located in a small village.\n„With four circular tables and a row counters,\n@the small room was bustling night and day.\n\n„People laughing and drinking...\n@Those stood around quietly...\n\n„The adventures were enjoying passing the time,\n@when the groan of the door opening sounded\n@the arrival of new visitors.\n

We're after Liruka Village's Guild, is this the right\nplace?\n\n
...Oi, so you're actually starting to ignore me\nnow?\n\n
I haven't seen your faces around here before.\nJudging by those outfits, I'd guess you're from\nthe capital?\n
Yeah. We're here to investigate the ancient ruins,\nby order of the Archduke of Kucellbull.\nI'm Ren, one of the Duchy Knights.\n
Likewise, I'm Veres, a Knight of the Dukedom.\nPleased to make your acquaintance.\n\n
Oh, it's you?\nI'd heard the news, but I wasn't expecting you to\nbe so young.\n
Heh heh.@We get that a lot.\n\n\n
„Veres ogled her, as if he hadn't already stared\n@hard enough.\n\n
I'm Charnet.@The Adventurer's Guild, Liruka Village\nBranch's receptionist, and Guildmaster.\n\n
Miss Charnet, you say...?\nWhat an elegant name.\n\n
Why, thank you.\n\n\n
...By the way, where are these ancient ruins that\nwere uncovered?\n\n
They were discovered several months ago, in a\nforest to the east of the village, but...\n\n
From the tales I've heard from the treasure\nhunters who went in before, it seems like it's\nquite the dangerous place, you know?\n
Don't worry about that!\nWe might not look the part, but we are knights.\n\n
A fair point.\nWell then, could you write your names on these\npapers?\n
„As she spoke, Charnet pulled two pieces of\n@paper out of a drawer in the counter, and\n@handed them to the men.\n
...Our names?\n\n\n
Yes.@You don't know? Before you can enter\nhistoric relics, you must register with the\nguild overseeing that jurisdiction.\n
Even though you're here by order of the\nArchduke, there are no exceptions. If you're going\nto enter the ruins, register with the guild.\n
Seriously...\nWe're gonna join the treasure hunters?\n\n
„Hesitating, Veres gave a backwards glance at\n@Ren, who had already finished writing his name.\n\n
It's fine, so get writing.\n\n\n
Ack! You didn't even give it a second thought,\ndid you!?\nYou sure work fast...\n
„Names signed, they handed their papers back to\n@Charnet.\n
All present and correct.\nWell then, you're all set to head off to the\nruins, but first...\n
By registering with a guild, you can receive a\nvariety of benefits to help you with your\nadventure. For instance...\n
„Charnet, producing piles of paperwork out of\n@nowhere, threw them down onto the counter-top\n@with a heavy thud.\n
These are...?\n\n\n
Requests that the guild has received about the\nruins.\n\n
People who have registered with the guild can\naccept these requests by paying a small contract\nfee.\n
If you manage to fulfil the request, you'll be\nrewarded for your work, and may even get some\nnew information about the ruins.\n
It might even lead to developments in your\ninvestigation...\nThis could prove to be key to your mission.\n
Err, no... This and that seem like two different\nthings.\n\n
Well, don't be so hard-nosed, you might as well\ntry accepting one for now. Right?\n\n
„Ren and Veres glanced back and forth between\n@each other's faces, and the mountains of\n@requests piled in front of them.\n
Ah... Ren, sorry! I just remembered, I was asked\nto see to another matter regarding our search\nof the ruins.\n
...Another matter?@I never heard about this.\n\n\n
It's a really important mission!\nSo, this is where we'll have to part ways.\nI'll leave this place to you.\n
I'm counting on you, buddy!\n\n\n
„With those parting words, Veres left the guild\n@in a flash.\n\n
„Left all alone, Charnet stared at Ren with a\n@daring smile.\n\n
„Ren reluctantly picked up one of the request\n@papers.\n\n
Phew... I'm kinda tired.\n\n\n
...I guess this is as good a place as any to take\na break.\n\n
„Having been walking through the ruins, Ren\n@leaned against a nearby wall ready to sit\n@down, when...\n
...!!?!\n\n\n
......\n\n\n
„Startled by a ghost who suddenly appeared,\n@Ren made an out-of-character decision to\n@run for it as fast as he could.\n„However, there was no indication that the ghost\n@was following.\n\n„Thinking it was suspicious, Ren timidly retraced\n@his steps...\n\n
......\n\n\n
.........\n\n\n
............\n\n\n
...Aren't you going to run away?\n\n\n
...!!\n\n\n
Ah, no, I was a bit shocked when you suddenly\nappeared, but... it doesn't look like you have\nany bad intentions...\n
...\n\n\n
(Wait a minute... Maybe this is the ghost mentioned\nin the request...?)\n\n
...\n\n\n
...S-say.\n\n\n
...Yes?\n\n\n
Um... Do you know of Liruka Village, just near\nhere?\n\n
...Yes, I'm familiar with it.\n\n\n
An old woman from the village named <C03>Granje<C04> told\nme that she can hear a woman crying from the\nruins at night...\n
...She probably means me.\n\n\n
Ah, so I was right.\n\n\n
She seemed quite concerned about you...\n\n\n
Erm... Is there something upsetting you?\n\n\n
Something upsetting...?\n\n\n
...Yes. There is much troubling me.\n\n\n
...\n\n\n
(...Urk. The atmosphere is so heavy. But, this is\nalso part of my job...)\n\n
...S-say.\nI'm here, if you want to talk about it...?\n\n
...Talk about it?\n
...Ah, you don't have to if you don't want to.\nBut, it you talk and let it all out, maybe youfll\nfeel a little better after?\n
...\n\n\n
...Then, may I share my story with you?\n\n\n
Go ahead.\n\n\n
I... have been in these ruins for a long, long time.\n\n\n
I don't know the exact time anymore.\n\n
But, when I was alive, I was involved in the\nconstruction of this site.\n\n
The construction of the ruins...\nOi oi, you're talking over a thousand years ago.\n\n
That's about right.\n\n\n
Well, I say construction, but it was actually made\nusing the art of alchemy.\n\n
Alchemy...\n\n\n
...The nation of Reville?\n\n\n
Oh! You know of it!?\n\n\n
...Ah-- No, just the name.\n\n\n
Well, I'm sure you must have also heard of Magicite\nthen.\n\n
As you probably know, Magicite is the result of a\nsuccessful attempt to use alchemy to trap the\npower of nature within a stone.\n
A stone with the power of fire, sets things alight,\na stone with the power of water, drips cold water.\n\n
After conducting such research, we, the people\nof Reville, created the stone hoping that it would\nprove useful for all life...\n
But, the stone, which had become an indispensable\npart of our daily lives, ended up being used as a\ntool for warfare.\n
...Many people died as a result.\n\n\n
Not only people.\nOur civilization itself was also destroyed.\n\n
And, it was us who set it all into motion.\n\n\n
We didn't mean it...\nNot that such an excuse bears any weight, given\nhow incredible a mistake it was.\n
...\n\n\n
We tried to fix our sins... That is, we sealed away\nall the creatures created by alchemy, and our own\nsouls, inside these walls.\n
...You mean, you all took your lives in these ruins?\n\n\n
Yes, that is correct.\n\n\n
Some found peace and their souls passed from this\nworld... Others were influenced by the power of\nthe stone and turned into monsters...\n
And, some like me managed to hold onto their sense\nof self and continue to cling to this place,\nperhaps out of guilt.\n
...A little while ago, you said that a thousand\nyears have passed since the site was created,\nyes?\n
...Even after that much time has passed, the\nregrets still do not fade.\n\n
...Why, why did we make such a thing...?\n\n
The fault isn't with the people who created it.\nIt's the ones who used it that are to blame.\n\n
...I can't comfort you with those words.\n\n\n
I think a creator has to take responsibility for\nwhat they create.\n\n
But haven't you taken your fair share of\nresponsibility?\n\n
In the outside world, humanity has been taking\nsteps forward for hundreds of years.\n\n
Nobody thinks much of what happened here\nanymore.\n\n
...That's not to say that you shouldn't care at\nall.\n\n
Just that you shouldn't be so hard on yourself,\nyou know. ...I'm not really good at putting it into\nwords.\n
...I know what you are trying to say.\n\n\n
...You're very kind, aren't you?\nAll this time, not once has anyone listened to me\nlike this.\n
That alone is enough.\n...Thank you, truly.\n\n
Ah-- I didn't really do anything to deserve your\nthanks.\n\n
That's not true. Thanks to you, I feel a little\nbetter now.\n\n
If you'd like, please drop by again.\n\n\n
Next time, I'd love to hear your story.\n\n\n
Yeah, I'll stop by if I'm in the area.\n\n\n
Well, keep well... or, maybe I should say, rest in\npeace soon!\n\n
I think that will still be a way off yet.\n\n\n
...After all, I was able to meet such a wonderful\nand kind man like yourself...\n\n
...\n\n\n
...Thank you.\n\n\n
„Tucked away in a corner of Liruka Village was\n@a small shop.\n\n
„It is the sole smithery in the village, and\n@various weapons lined the walls to the ceiling.\n\n
„There, inside the store where the sound of\n@flames and iron being struck echoed all\n@around, Ren was stood stock still.\n
...Umm...\n\n\n
...Heeey!\n\n\n
Excuse meeee--!\n\n\n
Calling out over and over again...\nI'm not deaf, ya know?\n\n
„The person who finally came out was a young\n@man in work clothes, who appeared to be the\n@owner of the store.\n
Ah?@What, it's just some kid...?\nNot seen you around here before, what're\nyou after?\n
I've just registered with the guild, so I was\ntold to come and say hello...\n\n
Oh?@So you must be Ren.\nI heard the news, but... you really are just a kid.\n\n
Well, not that it matters.\n\n\n
If you're gonna make money, you gotta do your\njob properly no matter who it's for!\nThat's my mantra!\n
...eIt doesn't matterf he says, then why even\nbring it up?\n\n
Hm?@Did you say something?\n\n\n
No, nothing.\n\n\n
Well, anyways!\nI'm Lagnus. I own the place.\n\n
Should the need arise, you can come here to\n<C03>forge<C04> new weapons to equip, or <C03>enhance<C04> the\nones you already own.\n
Forge and enhance weapons?\n\n\n
Yeah.\nForging is when you make weapons from scratch...\n\n
...and enhancing is when you change a weapon\nthat already exists into a different weapon.\n\n
By the way, both require materials and money.\n\n\n
Of course, the better the weapons, the better\nquality material and the more money you'll need,\nbut...\n
Well, there's the guild round here where you\ncan take jobs, or you can go off and gather\nthem on your own.\n
To forge or strengthen weapons, I'll <C03>need raw\nmaterials and money<C04>... right?\n\n
Oh?@I guess you were paying attention.\n\n\n
<C05>@@@@@INFORMATION<C04>\n\nYou can now forge and enhance\nyour main weapon.\n\n<C03>Forge:<C04>       Combine materials\ntogether to create new weapons.\n<C03>Enhance:<C04>    Strengthen a weapon\nyou already own and change it\ninto something else.
...Wait, youfve gotta be kidding me.\nIs that small sword all you have?\n\n
Hm?@Ah, yeah it is.\nIt's light and easy to handle. It suits me fine.\n\n
„As he spoke, Ren showed off the sword he\n@had attached to his waist.\n\n
„Seeing that, Lagnus the Blacksmith was taken\n@aback and let out a large sigh.\n\n
Oi, oi... That's no good.\n\n\n
Taking it case-by-case and reacting to the\nsituation around you is the best way to fight...\n\n
...I know.@Just gimme a min.\nI'll let you have something good.\n\n
„That said, Lagus disappeared into the back\n@of the store.\n\n
...What's all that about?\n\n\n
*Fwoo...*\nThey haven't used in a long time so they're\na bit dusty but... there's life in them yet.\n
„Lagnus had come out from the back holding a\n@sword in each hand.\n\n
Here.\n\n\n
„He handed the two differently shaped swords\n@to Ren.\n\n
...These are?\n\n\n
For your first visit only!\nIt's a special service. After this, you'll have to\nshow your epatronagef, okay?\n
Fyi... The <C03>Foil<C04> is a gMedium Swordh, and the \n<C03>Long Sword<C04> is a gBig Swordh.\n\n
It's not a big deal, but it might be good to think\nof it as epractisef when you use them, at least\nuntil you get used to it.\n
...Speaking of, this is for you too.\n\n
„Ren placed the book he received into the\n@gKeyh category of his item pouch.\n\n
The book has a detailed description of the\ncharacteristics for each main weapon category.\n\n
If you want to know the differences between\nSmall Swords, Medium Swords and Big Swords\nthen you should give it a read.\n
<C05>@@@@@INFORMATION<C04>\n\n\n   The Main Weapons (swords)\n     are divided into three\n   major categories; Small\n    Swords, Medium Swords\n@     and Big Swords.\n\n           
<C05>@@@@@INFORMATION<C04>\n\nySmall Swordsz\nThese swords are light and easy\nto handle, allowing you to make\n<C03>consecutive attacks<C04>.\n\nHowever, you can't draw out the\nfull power in a single hit.
<C05>@@@@@INFORMATION<C04>\n\nyMedium Swordsz\nNot too light and not too heavy,\nthese are balanced, easy to use\nswords for beginners.\n\nThey're good at <C03>coping with\nany situation<C04>.
<C05>@@@@@INFORMATION<C04>\n\nyBig Swordsz\nThese swords have a long reach,\nand great potential. (<C03>They can \nperform charged attacks.<C04>)\n\nBut, there is a pause after each\nattack due to weight, making\nconsecutive attacks impossible.
Well, to start, don't strain yourself or think\ntoo hard. It's alright to just use them however\nfor now.\n
Right.@Thank you.\n...You're a surprisingly nice guy.\n\n
Thatfs eMr Lagnusf to you!\nSheesh. This is why brats without manners are...\n
Well anyway, for now you can try out the store\nand go check out what we have.\n\n
If you already have materials and money, you\ncan get making new weapons straight away.\n\n
So, what'll it be?\n\n\n
\n@@@Kucellbull Castle    Audience Chamber@ @\n\n
„By decree of the Archduke Kucellbull, every\n@knight in the duchy had arrived in that\n@small, decorative room.\n
„The room was strangely quiet, as if their\n@nerves had barred the sound.\n\n
„The knights, sworn to serve their country,\n@couldn't help but feel uneasy about the \n@summons, which they had no right to refuse.\n
„They were trying to avoid the gaze of...\n\n\n
„The 8th Archduke of Kucellbull.\n@Estrand Kucellbull.\n\n
„The Archduke inspected the assembly, and gave\n@a single cough as if to get their attention,\n@before opening his mouth...\n 
As most of you are already aware, ancient ruins\nwere recently discovered in Dorius.\n\n
The ruins are said to date back to the civilisation\nof Edenbar, believed to have been destroyed over\none thousand years ago...\n
The archaeologists sent out to investigate were\n...wiped out.\n\n
„The abrupt announcement stirred up the room...\n\n\n
„The voice of a single knight cut through the\n@noise.\n
...What exactly do you mean by ewiped out'?\n\n\n
Hrmh. It appears the ruins that were discovered,\nstill aren't dead.\n\n
...Not dead?\n\n\n
Even now, one thousand years since it's\nconstruction, the terrifying traps laid throughout\nthe ruins continue to work. That is to say...\n
Perhaps from the many years of neglect, the\ninterior seems to have turned into a den of\nmonsters.\n
„The room fell into a clamour for the second\n@time...\n\n
„The men began to question the Archduke.\n\n\n
So, the reason we were summoned is...?\n\n\n
Although the archaeologists are knowledgeable\nabout the ancient civilization, they have no way\nof fighting back against the monsters.\n
Therefore, I'd like you, the Knights of the Duchy,\nto ride for the ancient ruins, destroy the traps\nand monsters inside, and create a path.\n
I see. As you wish, Your Highness.\n\n\n
Oi oi oi, oi oi oi!\nDid you hear that!?\n\n
...Stop making a scene. Your voice is too loud.\n\n\n
'Course I'm gonna make a scene.\nAn unknown ruin where traps and monsters await...\nAs a man, you can't help but be lured in!\n
Yeah. I guess you're right.\n\n\n
Hah? Your apathy is as plain as ever.\nAren't you excited?\nDoesn't this make your heart start to pound?\n
Don't misunderstand, Veres.\nThis isn't a game.@It's work.\n\n
Psht.@That hard-headedness of yours never\nchanges...\n\n
You there! Pipe down!\n\n\n
Ehe... S-sorry.\n\n\n
*Ahem.*\nThen, we shall inform you once a decision is made\nas to when you will depart.\n
Until then, see to it that you make your\npreparations.\n\n
Yes, sire!\n\n\n
„With the Archduke's speech over, the knights\n@that had gathered round began to file out of\n@the audience chamber.\n
Veres. We should get going too.\n\n\n
Y-yeah.@...Ancient ruins, huh...?\n\n\n
„A gleeful smile spread across Veres' face, as\n@if he was having a runaway daydream.\n\n
„Ronixis, commander of the Duchy Knights,\n@approached the two men, and spoke his mind.\n
Veres, can't you do something about that slovenly\nface of yours?\n\n
Oh, C-Captain!@Forgive me!\n\n\n
....Enough.\nMore importantly, the Archduke wishes to speak.\nThe two of you should stay behind.\n
Huh!?@eThe two of you'... As in, US?\n\n\n
Do you see me talking to anyone else?\n\n\n
For real!?\n\n\n
If it's not about the ruins then... there's\nsomething else?\n\n
I wonder.\nI haven't heard anything.\n\n
Anyway, make sure you show some respect, else\nI'll be the one taking the blame for it!\n\n
Got it.\n\n\n
We know, we know, Captain.\nLet's go, Ren.\n\n
...I'm not feeling reassured.\n\n\n
Oh, you're here?\n\n\n
We heard that you had something to tell us?\n\n\n
Mmm. The truth is, I'd like you to go on ahead\nto the ruins, as an advance party.\n\n
...An advance party?\n\n\n
It's dangerous, there's no telling what might\nhappen if I blindly send men in. I hope to ward off\nthe chance of our forces being annihilated.\n
The two of you are still young, but I have heard\nfrom Ronixis that your strength comes guaranteed.\n\n
Your words are too kind.\n\n\n
You humble yourself.@Will you do it?\n\n\n
Of course, sire.\n\n\n
Excellent. ...There is just one more thing.\n\n\n
What now?\n\n\n
...Are you aware of the stone known as gMagiciteh\nsaid to have supported the civilization of\nEdenbar's prosperity from the shadows?\n
„Even though he was puzzled by the Archduke's\n@sudden question, Ren opened his mouth and\n@quietly started to speak.\n
...A mysterious, sparkling blue crystal imbued with\nthe power of the earth. Whoever possess it will\nobtain powers equal to that of a God...\n
It's a legend that has been passed down for\ngenerations, correct?\n\n
It's true that there are those who will insist\nthat it does not exist, and yet there can be\nno doubt that it was real.\n
What's more, there's a chance that the stone is\nresting within the ancient ruins, still intact.\n\n
So we are...?\n\n\n
As the advance party, the two of you shall creep\ninto the ruins, assess the situation, and ascertain\nwhether or not the gMagiciteh exists.\n
And, in the event that you do make a marvellous\ndiscovery, you are to secretly recover it, and\nbring it back to me with the utmost haste.\n
There is no need to let anyone else know about\nthis. Understood?\n\n
...For what purpose would the stone be used?\n\n\n
You need not worry about such things.\nJust focus on completing your mission.\n\n
As you wish, Your Highness.\nAs soon as we find the mysterious stone,\nwe will bring straight back to you.\n
Mmm.@Then, you should head to the ruins without\ndelay. They were discovered in the Lorayne\ndistrict... Close to a small village called Liruka.\n
Start by paying a visit to the guild in Liruka.\n\n\n
If you let them know that you're there to inspect\nthe ruins by royal decree, they will see to your\nneeds.\n
Sire! Then, we shall be on our way.\n\n\n
Hrmh. I hope you will return with good news.\n\n\n
Hey! Did you catch that!?\n\n\n
No duh.@I was stood right next to you.\n\n\n
So, we'll be going to the ruins first.\nThis oughta be fun.\n\n
Perhaps.\n\n\n
Psht.@You really are a dull guy, ya know?\n\n\n
Still... gMagiciteh, eh?\nI always thought it was just a myth.\n\n
But... It's still bugging me.\nIf the Archduke gets his hands on some, what\non earth is he planning to do with it?\n
He just told us not to worry.\nWhatever he wants to use it for is none of\nour business.\n
Don't go all apathetic on me now.\nI mean, what if the gMagiciteh is--\n\n
If I may...\n\n\n
„The two men turned around to look at whoever\n@had interrupted them.\n\n
„Standing there was the eldest daughter of\n@the Archduke, Lady Elza Kucellbull.\n\n
„Her girlish, pretty face had a slightly solemn\n@expression...\n\n
Elza...?\n\n\n
My my, Lady Elza.\nHow do you do?\n\n
Don't play stupid.\n...I overheard you talking before.\n\n
Before...?\nAh, about us going on ahead to investigate\nthe ruins?\n
Yes, that.\n\n\n
So, you came rushing to congratulate us on\nbeing appointed as the advance party?\n
Well... It was only natural, given our talents,\nonly natural`\n\n
That's not it!@...I'm worried.\n\n\n
Elza?\n\n\n
I have a bad feeling...\nLike, something's going to happen to the two\nof you...\n
......\n\n\n
Anyways!\nPlease rest assured, Lady Elza.\n\n
Once we've finished our mission, we'll be sure\nto come back in one piece.\n\n
...Yes, you're right.\nYeah.@It'll be okay, won't it?\n\n
Ah... I should be getting back soon.\n\n\n
Yeah.@We'd better be going soon too...\n\n\n
Right.\nWell, we'll be off then, Elza.\n\n
Yes... But please, be careful.\n\n\n
Sir Ronixis! Hurry!\n\n\n
L-Lady Elza. Please slow down a little...\n\n
Goodness... You're all over the shop!\n\n\n
Is such behaviour appropriate for the Knight\nCommander?\n\n
Hahaha.\nYou've hit me where it hurts most.\n\n
Still, even though you were finally given permission\nby the Archduke to leave the city...\n\n
Whatever made you want to come all this way to\nsuch an empty village?\n\n
Well, Ren are Veres are in this village right now,\naren't they?\n\n
Wha--\nYou came all this way just to see those two!?\n\n
Yes, that's right.\nEspecially Ren, he never shows his face whenever\nhe comes back to the castle, you know?\n
That's why I thought I'd go to see him.\n\n
...Lady Elza. I have been by your side for a long\ntime now, so I know...\n\n
You have not been able to make any friends your\nown age... That can be lonely, or you may have\nalready had to lock away those feelings.\n
But when I see you with that noble air, befitting\nof a princess, it makes me proud.\n\n
However, since meeting those two, I fear you may\nhave crossed the line of proper conduct...\n\n
...\n\n\n
I know what I've said is rude.\n\n\n
I don't mean to cause offense. It's just, you are\nthis dukedom's princess, and they are but knights.\n\n
Please bear the weight of that in mind so that\nyou do not act irresponsibly.\n\n
...I'm well aware.\n\n\n
Lady Elza...\n\n\n
Ren is always telling me the same thing, and, when\nI'm talking to them, I feel the existence of that\ninvisible wall even stronger...\n
...\n\n\n
But regardless, we did come all this way.\nI am allowed to talk to them, right?\n\n
...You're right.\nRegrettably, it seems I am your only bodyguard,\nand just for today, I shall overlook it.\n
Thank you.\n\n\n
Then, I'll head to the village guild to ask for\nnews of Ren and Veres.\n\n
Lady Elza, please wait here for a while.\n\n\n
Right. I'll leave it to you.\n\n\n
...\n\n\n
So, it really is hopeless...\n\n\n
...I wish I hadn't been born a princess.\n\n\n
...No, no! I can't let myself get depressed.\nSince I've come all this way to see Ren, I must\ngreet him with a cheerful, smiling face.\n
Right! Smile, Elza!\nThere's no use worrying about things that can't\nbe changed.\n
Because I am me, after all.\n\n\n
...\n\n\n
...Ronixis is sure running late.\n\n\n
Kekekeke...\n\n\n
Eek! A m-monster...!?\n\n\n
Kekekeke...\n\n\n
N-no...!\nD-don't come near me...!\n\n
S-someone... save me......\nRen...!!\n\n
Elza!!\n\n\n
R-Ren...!\n\n\n
Are you okay?\n...Wait, what are you even doing here?\n\n
...Ren, thank goodness...\nI... I.......\n\n
Jeez...\nYour habit of getting into trouble hasn't changed.\n\n
Here. Stand up.\n\n\n
...\n\n\n
What's wrong?\n\n\n
...I can't get up.\n\n\n

I don't have the strength...\n\n\n

Get on my back.\n\n\n
Is that okay?\n\n\n
I can't exactly leave you here, can I?\n...This is part of my job too.\n
...Thank you.\n...Here goes....\n\n
Ngh. ...You're unexpectedly heav--\n\n\n
Say any more and I'll hit you!\n\n\n
...You already have.\n\n\n
Hehehe...\n\n\n
...What?\n\n\n
Eh, you don't remember?\nThis has happened before, you know?\n\n
Is that right?\n\n\n
It did! Let me think... it was when I was caught in\na fight with some man I didn't know in the castle\ntown, and you came to save me.\n
That time I was asked to escort you shopping,\nhuh...?\n\n
...Come to think of it, you were too faint to stand\nback then as well.\n\n
...T-that's because it was really frightening.\n\n\n
But you said something to me back then...\n\n\n
...gI will protect you.h\n\n\n
With that simple statement, I felt so reassured.\n\n\n
...I said that?\n\n\n
You did.\n\n\n
Well, not that I remember.\n\n\n
Grr` ...You're just going to play it cool again...?\nYou're always like that.\n\n
Which reminds me... There was something I forgot to\nask you that time.\n\n
Something you wanted to ask?\n\n\n
Yes. ...This is the second time you've come to my\nrescue now, but...\n\n
Why did you help me?\n...Just because it's your job?\n\n
...\n\n\n
Hey... answer me...\n\n\n
Lady Elza!\nI went to speak to the guild but... Wh-- Ren!?\n\n
Oh, Captain.\n\n\n
...You have the worst timing.\n\n\n
Hm? Did you say something?\n\n\n
It was nothing...\n\n\n
So, what are you doing here, and why is Lady Elza\non your back?\n\n
I'm the one who should be asking you what you're\ndoing here.\n\n
But more importantly, Captain, why did you leave\nElza alone whilst you wandered off?\n\n
„Ren told Ronixis about how Elza had been\n@attacked by a monster.\n
W-what did you say... A monster!?\nL-l-l-l-lady Elza! A-a-are you hurt--!?\n\n
I'm fine. My legs were just paralysed by the\nshock. I'm not injured anywhere.\n\n
I-I am glad to hear that.\n\n\n
Save it.\nYou're the one who brought her here...\n\n
It's just good that I happened to be passing by\nwhen I did...\n\n
Yes... It was most reckless of me.\nI'm sorry, Ren.\n\n
And Lady Elza, please forgive me... \n\n\n
I-I really am fine, so don't look so glum. Okay?\n\n\n
Still... I don't know what you came here for, but\nwouldn't it be better to take Elza home as soon\nas possible?\n
You're right. It will be getting dark soon.\nWe should head back.\n\n
Eh? We're leaving already?\n\n\n
You've only just escaped from danger, you really\nought to take it easy...\n\n
...Alright.\n\n\n
Ren, I'll be waiting for you at the castle, so the\nnext time you're back, you must drop by.\nPromise me!\n
...Lady Elza...\n\n\n
...Ah--\n\n\n
Fine, I've got it, so go home already.\n\n\n
And Captain, you're an old man already, so don't\noverdo it.\n\n
Nck! I'm going to ignore what you just said.\n\n\n
...Honestly! I'm going on ahead.\n\n\n
W-w-wait for me!\n\n\n
...What did those two even come here for?\n\n\n
Phew...\nIt feels like it's been a really long time since I\nlast saw daylight.\n
But, never in my wildest dreams would I have\nguessed there were such beasts with three heads.\n\n
That has to be... the result of the Magicite.\n\n\n
Meaning there's a high chance that the stone is\nresting within the ruins.\n\n
I'm also curious about the eNation of Reville' in\nthe book that Veres found...\n\n
...Guess I should return to Kucellbull Castle and\nreport on what's been going on.\n\n
As for Veres...\n\n\n
...Better to just drop it.\n\n\n
Ren of the Duchy Knights calling.\nI have returned.\n\n
Oh? Welcome back.\n\n\n
And how fares the ruins investigation?\nIs all going well?\n\n
There hasn't been that much progress as of yet,\nbut...\n\n
„Ren spoke of his encounter with the huge three\n@headed beast, and the effect of the Magicite.\n\n
...I see. It's true that I've only ever heard of\nthree headed beasts and the ilk as the subject\nof fairy tales.\n
Which you mean to say, was the result of the\nMagicite, and given that the giant beast exists,\nthe Magicite must also exist somewhere...?\n
Yes. And, there is one more thing.\n\n\n
Is Your Highness familiar with the nation known\nas eReville'?\n\n
The Nation of Reville? I haven't heard the name...\nAre you saying they have something to do with\nthe Magicite?\n
I'm not sure it they have anything to do with\nthe stone, but...\n\n
Apparently, they're a people with a deep\nconnection to the ancient ruins.\n\n
There was a description to that nature in a\nbook that Veres, who I was sent to investigate\nwith, found in the ruins...\n
Hm. It is certainly curious...\nYou have uncovered more than we expected.\n\n
Further investigation of the ruins should reveal\nmore details about this 'Nation of Reville'.\n\n
Return to the ruins and continue investigating\nat once. Understood?\n\n
Sire!\n\n\n
„After finishing his report, Ren left the Archduke\n@and made ready to leave for Liruka.\n\n
Right then, suppose I should get going...\n\n\n
Wait, Ren!\n\n\n
You know... If you're back, you should at least\ncome and say hi!\n\n
O-oi... There's no need to be so loud.\n\n\n
Don't forget the difference in our standings.\nEven just talking is...\n\n
That kind of thing doesn't matter.\n\n\n
............\n\n\n
It's not like everyone in the castle doesn't\nalready know that in the first place, right?\n\n
...It just means more trouble for me, though.\n\n\n
Ah. What a horrible thing to say.\n\n\n
It's the truth.\n\n\n
You really have no manners.\n\n\n
...I was worried, you know.\n\n\n
It's work. I don't have much choice.\n\n\n
Heartless as ever, I see.\n\n\n
Well, even if things get a little dangerous, when\nRen and I are together, it's pretty much child's\nplay. Right?\n
Don't lump me together with you.\n\n\n
Honestly, you get carried away so easily...\n...Wait, Veres--!? When did you get here!?\n\n
Heh heh. I thought I should come and show my\nface so I wouldn't worry the Lady Elza.\n\n
...Don't just pop up out of nowhere.\n\n\n
Hah? Did you say something?\n\n\n
No, nothing.\n\n\n
Hehe...\n\n\n
Come to think of it, what was that other matter\nyou had to take care of in the end?\n\n
Other matter? What are you on about?\nDid I say something like that?\n\n
............\n\n\n
Woah` Ren dear, that's a scary face you're\nmaking. If the wind changes, your face might\nstick like that, yfkno?\n
Why you-- Treating me like Ifm some kid...\n\n\n
Hehehe... Ahahahahaha!\n\n\n
Elza?\n\n\n
Did we... break Elza...?\n\n\n
Aaaah`...\nWe haven't had a chance to talk like this with\njust the three of us lately, have we?\n
That's why it just made me happy.\n\n\n
Right? Right?\nAs I thought it's just hopeless when I'm not\naround, right?\n
Yes. And Ren too, of course.\n\n\n
............\n\n\n
...I think itfs always like this with the three of\nus, but...\n\n
...when I think about it, the two of you really\nhaven't changed at all since we first met.\n\n
I just wanted to go for a little stroll around\nthe castle...\n\n
That's not a stroll.\nItfs called an escape attempt.\n\n
You don't have to spell it out!\n\n\n
Back then, me and Ren were walking around the\ncastlefs courtyard on patrol.\n\n
...Right. And then we saw this shabby-looking girl...\n\n
You could have done without the eshabby' part!\n...Well, not that I can deny it.\n\n
So, we never could've guessed that her highness\nwould be looking like that, and we got the wrong\nidea thinking you were up to something fishy.\n
You did!\nThe two of you were being so rude, even I got\na bit worked up and argued.\n
But in the middle of that, Ren wanted to take me\naway and Veres, you insisted on taking me back to\nyour room instead, so the two of you fought...\n
The other knights heard the noise and came\nrushing...\n...and we got into a whole load of trouble.\n
Yeah... I practically had my ears chewed off\nafter that...\nAnd we didn't even do anything wrong...\n
So trying to take Elza to your room was...?\n\n\n
No, that was... Right!\nThat was cuz I wanted to take my time to question\nher about why she was out there and...\n
...Not that it really matters anymore.\n\n\n
That was the first time I'd ever raised my voice\nso much, and also the first time anyone had ever\nbeen so rude to me.\n
...To think that I'd have friends like that, it\njust`` Just made me kinda happy.\n\n
So much time has passed since then but, here you\nare, quarrelling over something trivial again...\nYou really haven't changed.\n
Haven't changed, huh...?\n\n\n
That's right... Nothing's changed.\nSince then, nothing has...\n\n
Something wrong?\n\n\n
Ah-- No, it's nothing.\n\n\n
Oh? If it isn't Ren and Veres.\n\n\n
Captain! Long time no see.\n\n\n
When did you get back?\n...Wait, now's not the time for all that.\n\n
Lady Elza. The Archduke is calling for you.\nPlease return as soon as possible.\n\n
Father is...?\n\n\n
Yes. Well, I have somewhere else I need to be, so\nLady Elza, if you please...\n\n
...I stayed longer than I meant to myself.\nI should be getting back soon.\n\n
Yes, I had better go too.\n\n\n
Ah, but the next time you're back, you have\nto come and talk with me properly. Alright?\n\n
If I feel like it.\n\n\n
...Honestly!\n\n\n
Then... be safe, both of you.\n\n\n
„Walking away slowly, as if she didn't want to\n@say goodbye, Elza took her leave.\n@\n
Right, let's go.\n\n\n
Oh, I still have a bit more to do here, so go ahead\nand push on with the search again without me.\n\n
...That other thing of yours, huh?\nCan't you at least tell me what it's about?\n\n
Ah` ...W-well another time, yeah?\nSee you at the ruins!\n\n
...No matter.\n\n\n
For now, I should focus on my own job and finish\nthe rest of the investigation.\n\n
First off, I guess I should drop by the guild...\n\n\n
...\n\n\n
Veres!? You're back from the ruins?\n\n\n
...Yes.\n\n\n
Hm? It's not like you to be so withdrawn.\n\n\n
Well, the Archduke is waiting.\nGive him your report.\n\n
„Veres nodded and made his way to the audience\n@chamber.\n\n
Oh, if it isn't Veres?\nIt seems you made it back safely.\n\n
Sire.\n\n\n
...Well, did you obtain the stone?\n\n\n
Yes. I have it...\n\n\n
Marvellous!\nHurry, let me see it.\n\n
Here. Feast your eyes.\n\n\n
„Veres opened his hands wide, showing his body\n@to the Archduke.\n\n
...What is the meaning of this?\nDon't you have the stone on you?\n\n
If you would look here.\n...This is the power of the Magicite.\n\n
Wha--!? T-this is--!?\n\n\n
„Veres' body lit up brightly.\n\n
„On that signal, the castle gave a large groan\n@and began to collapse.\n\n
W-what!? What's going on!?\nVeres! What have you done!?\n\n
I just told you, didn't I?\nThis is the power of the Magicite.\n\n
I-it can't be...\nDid you absorb it into your body!?\n\n
I only did what you were planning to do.\n\n\n
...In other words, you're no longer required.\n\n\n
Y-you wretch--!\n\n\n
„Veres reached out a hand towards the Archduke.\n@With that act alone, the Archduke Kucellbull\n@foresaw his death.\n
Don't------!!!!\n\n\n
...Don't worry. I'll take good care of this country.\n\n\n
„Stood before the Archduke's lifeless body, Veres\n@quietly smiled.\n\n
W-what in the...\nVeres, you--!!\n\n
You took great care of me over these years. But,\nthat too ends today.\n\n
The wine I wanted to drink with you one day...\nOnly that, I regret a little...\n\n
Guah--!!\n\n\n
„Ronixis, who had readied his sword to stand up\n@to Veres, met with his cruel fate before even\n@getting a chance to use it.\n
„...Looking at the two men lying on the floor,\n@Veres gave a short sigh.\n\n
Now then, next is...\n\n\n
„After reconfirming the plan in his mind, just as\n@Veres was about to move, a slow creak came\n@from the door...\n
Veres! What are you doing!?\n\n\n
Well well, Princess Elza.\nComing here all by yourself... You've saved me the\ntrouble of looking for you.\n
Stop fooling around! What on earth--\n\n\n
...F-father!?\n\n\n
„Noticing the Archduke's body lying at Veres'\n@feet, Elza fell to her knees...\n\n
Your father has breathed his last. ...Just now, in\nfact.\n\n
„Veres made his way towards Elza, one step at a\n@time...\n\n
But, it's okay.\nI'm going to be with you from now on.\n\n
So, you won't be lonely.\n\n\n
Veres... No, were you the one who--!?\n\n\n
With this power... I will forge a new coun...try...\n\n\n
N...ngh...\n\n\n
„Veres suddenly clasped his head and began to\n@writhe in agony.\n\n
„Besides him, Elza was still struggling to\n@comprehend the situation.\n\n
What happened, Veres!?\nAre you... really Veres!?\n\n
...*Pant, pant*.\nI-it's okay, Elza. Don't worry.\n\n
I, I... As if I'm going to let myself be completely\ntaken over by some stone--!\n\n
Stone...?\n\n
„As she stared at him quizzically, Veres picked\n@Elza up with one hand.\n\n
Aaaaagh!\nW-wait, Veres! Put me down!\n\n
It's okay... Everything's okay...\n\n\n
Wha... It's not okay!\nThis situation... Father.... Fatheeeeer!!\n\n
Let's go together, to the new world I will build.\n\n\n
„Carrying Elza over his shoulder, Veres once again\n@disappeared, the same way he had in the ruins...\n\n
Lady... Elza...\n\n\n
„A few hours after Veres had left...\n\n\n
...This is--!?\n\n\n
„The once beautiful Kucellbull Castle...\n\n\n
„Walls had collapsed, burying those inside...\n@That sight, which was truly the image of hell\n@itself, pierced through Ren's heart.\n
„The world as he knew it had been completely\n@shattered, leaving him stood frozen, unable to\n@move...\n
„Just then, a faint voice echoed from the back\n@of the room.\n\n
...Ren... Ren, i-is that you...?\n\n\n
...!?\n\n\n
Captain Ronixis!?\nWhat the...\n\n
I-it seems... You are still sane...\n\n\n
I...?\n\n\n
It can't be, Veres--!?\n\n\n
...You might not believe it, but this was all his\ndoing...\n\n
I tried to stop him but... He got me first...\n\n\n
...I don't know what happened in the ruins, but...\nthat's not the Veres we know any more...\n\n
...No, maybe he was no longer human from the\nstart...\n\n
Not human...?\n\n\n
G...Go, Ren... You have to stop him...\n\n\n
Captain Ronixis...\n\n\n
Princess... Elza is... in troub...le...\n\n\n
Cap...tain...?\n\n\n
„In Ren's arms, Ronixis quietly breathed his last...\n\n\n
„...Ren held back his tears. He knew that now\n@wasn't the time.\n\n
Back in the ruins, he said gthis place shall be\nour castle"...\n\n
...Elza!!\n\n\n
„Leaving the castle behind him, Ren set off for\n@the ruins once again.\n\n
*Sigh...*\nThat was pretty exhausting.\n\n
A three-headed beast, a giant sand snake, and...\ndragons...\n\n
It's enough to make anyone lose their mind.\n\n\n
And there's also the matter of the Magicite\nfragment... I guess I should head back to\nKucellbull Castle for the time being.\n
„Despite the weariness slipping in and out of his\n@bones, Ren made his way back to the castle with\n@speed.\n
Ren of the Duchy Knights calling.\nI have returned.\n\n
Oh it's you, Ren?\n\n\n
Well, has there been any progress?\n\n\n
As a matter of fact...\n\n\n
„Ren told the Archduke of the nation of Reville\n@who created the Magicite...\n
„The sand snake who had grown larger than ever\n@thought possible, the dragons of dark green,\n@gold and crimson...\n
„And the fragment of Magicite that Veres had\n@shown him deep within the second layer of the\n@ruins.\n
...A fragment of Magicite, hm?\n\n\n
But Veres said the fragment doesn't have the\ninherent power of the stone, correct?\n\n
Yes...\n\n\n
„Ren hadn't mention the changes he'd felt after\n@touching the fragment.\n\n
„After all, even he wasn't sure whether that\n@phenomenon had been caused by the power of\n@the stone...\n
But as you say, the fact that a fragment remains,\nmeans the possibility of a perfect piece of Magicite\nexisting is becoming more and more likely.\n
Hm... Very good.\nThe day when I can make that power my own draws\nnearer...\n
...?\n\n\n
Well, it may be the final stage of the ruins\ninvestigation, but focus more than ever and\ndeliver the Magicite without fail.\n
Understood?\n\n\n
Sire!\n\n\n
„After finishing his general report Ren came to\n@a stop, with a face that looked lost in thought.\n\n
...It doesn't really matter to me what that guy\ngets up to.\n
But if it goes against the Archduke's orders,\nthen I'll have to put a stop to it, even if it\nmeans using force.\n
„Veres' actions inside the ruins still weighed on\n@his mind...\n
Oh, if it isn't Ren!\n\n\n
Captain...\n\n\n
Don't tell me you were just planning to report\nto the Archduke and head off again, were you?\n\n
That was the idea...\n\n\n
Can't you have a little more concern for other\npeople's feelings?\n\n
It's not like even I don't worry about you guys,\nyou know?\n\n
No matter how worried you are, it won't change\nthe fact that I have to leave for the ruins.\n\n
And, though it is certainly a strange place, it's\nnot a mission that puts me under any more strain\nthan normal.\n
...That's not the problem here.\n\n\n
Speaking of, what happened to Veres?\nHe's not with you?\n\n
He said he had a different matter to investigate.\n\n\n
Something else?\n\n\n
I've tried asking, but he always dodges the\nquestion... I don't know what it's about, but...\nit seemed to be important.\n
I see. That's rare.\n\n\n
Rare?\n\n\n
From the day you both joined the Knights, you've\nnearly always been together.\n\n
Training, fighting, and even your room is shared.\n\n\n
It's not like we were particularly trying to stick\ntogether.\n\n
But it's not that you don't enjoy it, right?\n\n\n
Do you remember? That night when you branded\nLady Elza as suspicious...\n\n
Yeah. You mean when, after shouting at us innocent\nvictims, this guy old enough to know better told us\na sad story about his hobby of drinking alone?\n
...That's the gist of it, but show a little more\nrespect for your boss.\n\n
We made a promise back then, remember?\nThat when you came of age, the three of us would\ndrink together.\n
...You're still not of age, yet you two came to be\nentrusted with a mission like this.\n\n
Once it's all been settled...\n\n\n
I don't drink.\n\n\n
At least have one!\n\n\n
We've been together ever since then, right?\n\n\n
Since I've been watching over you all this time,\nwhen I see you going off fulfilling your duties by\nyourselves, it makes me happy, and a bit lonely.\n
...You sound like an old man.\n\n\n
Hahaha. Our ages aren't that far apart, but\nsomehow I feel like a father raising a son.\n\n
Even if you are a pain, I still want to be there.\nThe two of you are precious to me.\n\n
If you see Veres, pass that on for me.\nWell then, until next time.\n\n
...Sons, huh?\n\n\n
„After talking with the captain, Ren headed for\n@the exit, ready to leave the castle.\n\n
„But when he got there, he found a girl blocking\n@the path.\n\n
...\n\n\n
...H-hey.\n\n\n
Again...\n\n\n
...?\n\n\n
You were about to break your promise and leave\nagain, weren't you?\n\n
Ah-- No...\n\n\n
Honestly... You really don't think about me.\n\n\n
...\n\n\n
I do. Protecting the dukedom's princess is one of\na knight's jobs.\n\n
Just like how making progress on the investigation\nis proper work. The Archduke has been urging us\non, too.\n
Right, right. Of course.\n\n\n
...\n\n\n
...Ah, speaking of which, have you seen Veres?\n\n\n
Veres? No, I've been here alone this whole time.\n...Did something happen to him?\n\n
I saw him in the courtyard not long ago.\n\n\n
He seemed to be mumbling to himself about\nsomething at first... So, I spoke to him.\n\n
And then... how should I put this... Something\nseemed different than usual.\n\n
It's hard to explain, but... like Veres was not\nquite Veres?\n\n
...I don't follow.\n\n\n
Mmm... Anyway, there was something off about his\nmanner.\n\n
I thought you might know something...\n\n\n
That guy's always been weird, you know.\n\n\n
...If Veres hears you say that, he'll cry.\n\n\n
Oh, right!\nSay, could you face the other way a second?\n\n
The other way?\n\n\n
Yes, behind you.\nStand here with your back to me.\n\n
Why?\n\n\n
Never mind that, turn around!\n\n\n
Here, this is for you.\n\n\n
A necklace...?\n\n\n
I thought it might suit you.\n\n\n
And it's supposed to protect whoever wears it.\n\n\n
So it's perfect for you always visiting dangerous\nplaces, right?\n\n
I told you, you worry too much...\n\n\n
It's fine` It's not like it can do any harm.\n\n\n
That's not the point.\n\n\n
It's precisely the point.\n\n\n
...I'm worried about Veres too.\nPlease... Promise me you won't overdo it.\n\n
...\n\n\n
...Okay?\n...Please.\n\n
...I can't promise anything.\n\n\n
Why not?\n\n\n
I serve the duchy.\n\n\n
If it's an order from the Archduke, I must accept\nthe mission even if it puts my life in danger.\n\n
That's the job.\n\n\n
That's why, I might end up having to do reckless\nthings, or ...I might not return one day. \n\n
And, we're talking princesses and knights.\nI can't just go about making thoughtless promises.\n\n
...Nor do I want to.\n\n\n
...\n\n\n
...Right...\n\n\n
I'm a princess, and you're a knight.\nThat will never change.\n\n
...I should be heading back soon.\n\n\n
Ah, I ought to go too.\n\n\n
Right. Well... do be careful.\n\n\n
...I'm sorry.\n\n\n
...\n\n\n
...Well then, guess I should head back to the\nruins. I'm worried about Veres...\n\n
I dodged the issue with Elza but, there's definitely\nsomething funny going on with him.\n\n
...Probably since he first got his hands on that\nstone fragment.\n\n
...\n\n\n
I'd better find him, and fast...\n\n\n
„Ren once again left Kucellbull Castle, and made\n@his way for Liruka Village.\n\n
Now then...\n\n
Should I start with exploring the ruins?\n\n\n
Purrrrease wait`!\n\n\n
...What--?\n\n\n
Hello hello hello!\nHave you been well?\n\n
Avanc?\n\n\n
What's wrong? Calling me out in such a panic...\n\n\n
Delivery for Ren!\nI came to give you this!\n\n
Now now now!\nHurrry up and open it!\n\n
A key for the ruins? Why give it to me?\n\n\n
I don't know.\n\n\n
I just bumped into a man with long chestnut-\ncoloured hair who asked me to give it you\nwheneverrr I next saw you.\n
(...Long chestnut-coloured hair? Does he mean\nVeres?)\n\n
Did he say anything else?\n\n\n
That was it.\n\n\n
...I see. Well, thank you.\n\n\n
That is to say...\n\n\n
I n   e x c h a n g e`!\n\n\n
Make surrre you stop by Avanc's Item Shop next\ntime you need something!\n\n
There are all sorrrts of items waiting for you`!\n\n\n
...I don't know what Veres is thinking, but...\n\n\n
Now that I have this key, I should be able to go\ndeeper into the ruins.\n\n
...Okay, guess it's back to work.\n\n\n
