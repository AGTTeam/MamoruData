Roughly one thousand years ago...
There was an era of tremendous\nprosperity and great glory,\nbrought about by the power of the\n“Magicite”, a stone created by\nhighly-developed alchemy.
The legendary civilization said\nto have been destroyed in a single\nnight... Edenbar.
By absorbing the forces of nature,\nsuch as ‘fire', ‘water', ‘earth' and\n‘air', the “Magicite” that\nsustained the Edenbar civilization\nwas able to exert massive influence\nat will, a tainted power that\ntrespassed on God's domain. 
The people, acting out of self-\ninterest, abused the power without\nany consideration of the effect\nthat it would have on the world.
As a result, the balance of the\nnatural world crumbled. Having gone\ntoo far, the empire was left with\nno other path than to their ruin. 
And, in the present day...
We've received all sorts of requests from the\nvillagers, traders and hunter's association.
Come back once you've completed a quest.
You aren't currently on any quests, so there's\nnothing to see here.
Oh? Leaving so soon?
You can't take on two requests at the same time.\nFinish your current quest first.
You can abandon your current quest, but note\nthat the contract fee you paid won't be returned.\n
This quest is to assess your abilities as a new\nhunter.\nPlease see it through to the end.
You can report that you've finished a request at\nthe reception desk.\nDrop by any time.

I'm busy.\nHurry up and go home before you get hurt.\n\n
Have you come for warmth again?\n\n\n
Well, no need to hold back.\nDo make use of my flames to your heart's content.\n\n

Ah, looks like you managed to clear that quest.\nCongrats.\n\n
Well then, I'll give you your reward and the thank\nyou letter you received.\nHere, take these.\n

That’s odd... This Green Gel isn't attacking.\n\n\n
(Leave me alone, wiggle!)\n\n\n(You're wasting your time trying to talk to me,\n wiggle!)\n\n
＞No matter what he tried, the Green Gel didn't\n　react.\n\n＞It didn't seem like that was about to change\n　any time soon, so Ren left.\n\n
......\n\n\n
Oh...? To think there'd be a skeleton here...\nI'm amazed it's managed to stay upright...\n\n
*Creak...*\n\n\n
...Hm? It seemed to move just then...\n\n\n...Must have been my imagination.\n\n\n
＞It didn’t seem like anything was about to happen,\n　so Ren continued on.\n\n
......\n\n\n
Strange... There's a fire here.\n\n\nDid someone abandon their bonfire...?\n\n\n
＞Having found a blazing fire, Ren slowly drew\n　closer to warm his cold body.\n\n
It's unexpectedly cold in these ruins...\nThis thing's a lifesaver.\n\n
＞Holding both hands out to the crackling fire, \n　he surrendered his body to the warmth.\n\n＞...　...　...　...\n\n\n＞After enjoying the short break, Ren got back\n　on his feet once again.\n\n
ようやく来たか……\n待ちわびたよ。\n\n
ヴェルス ！\nエルザをどこにやった ！ ？\n\n
安心しろ。　奥の部屋で眠ってる。\n危害は加えてない。\n\n
一体どういうつもりだ ！ ？\nどうしてこんな事を……\n\n
言っただろ ？\n俺は何一つお前に勝てたことがない。\n\n
それは……騎士団の入団試験のときから、\n始まっていた。\n\n
入団、 試験…… ？\n\n\n

...A human?\nAye yai yai... They can make it this far in...\n\n
...A goblin?\n\n\n
Shut your face! Hurry up and shove off already!\nIf you don’t, I’ll have to use my bow and arrow...\n\n
...Come again?\n\n\n
Do you want to become Swiss cheese!?\n\n\n
O-oi! Don’t wave that thing about!\n\n\n
＞Ren decided to leave the small monster who\n　wasn't giving him a chance to speak and put\n　that place behind him.\n

No, it's not like that.\n\n\nI'm actually here because I took on a request\nfrom someone named <C03>Raith<C04>, who wanted me to\ncome and see how you were doing.\n
Raith...?\n\n\n...We used to play together a long time ago.\nRaith and Polum were friends, wiggle.\n\nBut...

Wha- Hold on a second!\nRaith asked me to pass on a message to you!\n\n

Are you going to listen to me now?\n\n\n
＞Ren told the Gel the full picture, why Raith\n　suddenly stopped going to visit, and how he\n　still cares about Polum to this day.\n
...Meaning, he didn't suddenly stop coming because\nhe didn't like you, or anything like that.\n\n
So that's why, wiggle...\nI just thought he hated me, wiggle.\n\nI'm a bit sad, but if that's what it was, it's\nokay wiggle!\n\nPolum has made new friends in the ruins too, and\nwe have fun, wiggle!\n\nPlease tell Raith not to worry, wigggle!\n\n\n

...You mean the Magicite? \n\n\n
...Aren't you well-informed?\n\n\nAye, they bound us as protectors of these\nRuins to stop anyone from getting their\nhands on that stone.\n...That includes sending fools like you to depths\nof darkness.
...Sorry to disappoint you, but I've no intention\nof losing my life in a place like this.\n\n
But I'll take the opportunity to free your\nfettered soul.\n\n
Human whelps... So impertinent.\n\n\n
...You are wrong to make an enemy of me.\n\n\n
I will teach you... the power of overwhelming fear...\n\n\n

*Creaaaak......*\n\n\n
N...no, it really can move!?\n\n\n

!?\n\n\n

Oh, right, right.\n\n\nIt's been so long since I last saw anyone, I\ncompletely forgot that I'd become like this.\nHahaha!\n
Ha, haah...\n\n\n
So, what on earth are you doing in a place like\nthis?\n\n
W-well, a woman named Anna from Liruka village put\nin a request at the guild...\n\n
＞Ren told the talking skeleton that he had come\n　to find <C03>Anna<C04>'s husband, an archaeologist, on her\n　request.\n＞The skeleton seemed to listen carefully, not\n　moving an inch.\n\n
...So, that's my story.\n\n\n
...I see.\n\n\n
You've been down here a long time, right?\nHave you seen anyone who seems to fit?\n\n
Well, she probably means me.\n\n\n
Wha--!?\n\n\n
I mean it.\nEven though I look like this, I'm an archaeologist.\n\nI discovered this site a few years ago and snuck\nin here on my own to investigate.\n\nAnd as a result, the mummy-hunter became the\nmummy, or skeleton... you get the drift.\n\nHa ha ha haa--\n*Cough, cough*!\n\nOh, pardon me. Even though this body is hollow,\nit's easy for things to get caught. Dearie me...\n\n
Er... So, what you're saying is...\n\n\n
Right. It's exactly what it looks like; I'm already\ndead.\n\nIt seems the power left here by the ancient\npeople still persists to this day...\n\nNot realising that, I was driven on by curiosity,\nand, thanks to an onslaught of hidden monsters,\nsaid my goodbyes to this world.\nBut strangely, even though I died, my soul didn't\nleave my bones, thus I got a body that will never\nrot.\n...However, it’s all down to the power of a most\ncurious stone called Magicite that fills these ruins.\n\nIf I take one step outside of this place, I might\nnever move again.\n\nBut, well I don't let it get me down. Thanks to\nthis, I can investigate the ruins without having\nto worry about time.\nHa ha ha haa--\n*Cough, cough*!\n\n......\n\n\n...I’ve done such an awful thing to my wife...\n\n\n
...\n\n\n
Still, I'm doing fine, despite being dead and all.\n\n\nI'm sorry to have to ask this, but could you let\nmy wife know what happened?\n\n
Yeah, I'll tell her.\n\n\n
Thank you.\nWell, do be careful on the way.\n\n
You too, keep well.\n\n\n
I'm always well!\n\n\nOr, as well as a dead guy can be. Ha ha ha haa--\n*Cough, cough*!\n\n
Then, I'll take my leave.\n\n\n
...A human?\nAye yai yai... They can make it this far in...\n\n
...A goblin?\n\n\n
Shut your face! Hurry up and shove off already!\nIf you don’t, I’ll have to use my bow and arrow...\n\n
...Come again?\n\n\n
Do you want to become Swiss cheese!?\n\n\n
O-oi! H-hold up!\nI'm here because I've got business with you!\n\n
I don’t want anything to do with the likes of you.\n\n\n
Would you just put that thing down for a second\nand listen to me!?\n\n
＞Raising his voice, Ren expressed his desire for\n　the Kobold to hear him out.\n\n＞Sensing the seriousness, the Kobold lowered its\n　bow.\n\n
...So, what “business” could a human like you\npossibly have with me?\n\n
Heh... So you finally feel like listening?\n\n\n
Nevermind that, out with it already!\n\n\n
R-right...\n\n\n
＞The commission from a man named <C03>Roy<C04> who was\n　saved by a Kobold whilst investigating the ruins...\n\n＞And the letter he had been entrusted with\n　containing those unspoken feelings of gratitude...\n\n＞Ren spoke with a cool voice as he explained the\n　situation to the Kobold.\n\n
...So, being a Kobold yourself, I wanted your help\nto find this Kobold who went out of his way to\nsave a human...\n
...Why should I do something like that?\n\n\nBesides... For monsters like me, it doesn't exactly\nmake us happy to receive thanks from a human.\n\nGetting a letter like that would just be revolting.\n\n\nMore likely, that Kobold you say was trying to help\nthis Roy, was actually just trying to steal his\nstuff.\n
＞As he said those cold words, a hint of loneliness\n　could be seen on the Kobold's face.\n\n
...That's a twisted way of seeing things.\n\n\n
Roy really was grateful.\n\n\nIf he hadn't been rescued when he was, he would\nhave died there, trapped in the depths of the\nruins.\nAnd for the Kobold, carrying Roy all the way to\nthe surface risked attack by both ferocious\nbeasts and humans...\nBut despite the danger, he decided to help.\n\n\nThat Kobold, at the very least, couldn't have been\nas twisted as you.\nI don't know how you could look at them...\nRoy, so truly grateful for the help, or the Kobold\nwho crossed the barrier of species to lend out his\nhand, and still say such things.\n
＞Each word he said without even taking a pause\n　for breath struck the Kobold at its core.\n\n＞Seeming to have resigned himself, the Kobold\n　suddenly let out a long sigh and raised its head.\n\n
Good grief...\n...Alright, fine.\n\nHand over that letter. I'll see to it that it gets\ndelivered.\n\n
You mean it!?\n\n\n
Yeah. Kobolds don't tell lies.\n\n\n
Ah, sorry.\nThen I'm counting on you.\n\n
＞Ren handed over the letter that the Guild had\n　entrusted him with.\n\n
Oh... right...\n\n\n
Hm? What is it?\n\n\n
M-mm... Well... Roy...\n\n\nPass this message on to that human, Roy.\n\n\n“Don't ever come back to the ruins! Even if you\nget hurt, I'm not gonna help you!”\n\n
Wha...?\n\n\n
＞As if trying to have the final say, the Kobold\n　disappeared from sight.\n\n＞The Kobold's awkward tenderness left Ren with a\n　small fuzzy feeling in his chest.\n\n
Mur!\n\n\n
...Hm?\n\n\n
Whatcha doing here, mur??\n\n\n
...You're awfully chatty.\n\n\n
I received a request about a Murmur who was\ntreated badly by humans in the past...\n\n
But even if it didn't come to hate humans, there's\nno way it'd be this friendly, right?\n\n
Mur??\nWhatcha muttering about, mur??\n\n
Er...\n(...Maybe I should still ask, just in case?)\n\n
Have you ever been to a village where humans live?\n\n\n
Where humans live...\n\n\n
...Mur been.\n\n\n
Really!?\n\n\n
...Are you gonna get mad with mur?\n...Are you gonna throw rocks at mur again?\n\n
...Throw rocks?\n\n\n
Long ago, mur went to a village full of humans\nbecause mur wanted to be friends with them.\n\n
And then, everyone started shouting and throwing\nrocks at mur.\n\n
Mur got scared and ran away, mur...\n\n\n
Did everyone get mad because mur went to a human\nplace?\n\n
...No, that's not it.\n\n\n
At that time, they were probably surprised that a\nmonster suddenly entered the village.\n\n
Some monsters are friendly like you, but there are\nstill a lot of them who attack humans.\n\n
So, when they saw you, I guess they misunderstood\nand thought you were going to attack.\n\n
Mur wouldn't do something like that, mur!\nMur just wanted to get along...\n\n
It's okay. There are some humans who want to get\nto know you too.\n\n
...When you were being driven away from village,\nthere was a woman there named <C03>Viola<C04>.\n\n
She wants to meet you and apologise.\nYou should go and make friends.\n\n
Really, mur?\nReally, really, mur?\n\n
Yeah. I was hired to pass along the message.\n\n\n
Well, now you know.\nGo, and be safe.\n\n
Mur!!\nMur going! Thank you, mur!\n\n

...The other rooms were bad enough, but this is\neven more creepy...\n\nStill, it's places like this where new discoveries lie.\n\n
...Hm? ...I hear something.\n\n\n
＞Was it because of the strange atmosphere that\n　filled the room...?  Or had the thought of\n　treasure close at hand made him careless...?\n＞Either way... Ren had failed to notice the\n　presence of the creature drawing ever closer...\n\n
Rooooooaaar!!\n\n\n
A d...dragon!?\n\n\n
...Why have you come here?\n\n\n
...!?\n\n\n
＞The giant dragon that had appeared from depths\n　of the darkness just stared at Ren...\n\n＞...and asked a question with a low voice that was\n　both quiet and intimidating.\n\n
............\n\n\n
＞Ren didn't answer.\n\n\n＞No... To be precise, he couldn't answer.\n\n\n＞Perhaps overwhelmed by the sudden appearance\n　of he dragon, he found himself unable to move\n　an inch.\n
Answer me. What business have you here?\n\n\n
...I’m investigating these ruins.\n\n\n
...A thief, then.\n\n\n
I am the <C03>Guardian<C04> of these ruins. I am bound to\nthis place, burdened with the task of protecting\nit...\n...Are you so foolish that you can't understand my\nwords?\n\n
＞The tone of the dragon who was speaking quietly\n　had changed slightly.\n\n＞Ren who had been listening in silence, noticed\n　the change and came back to his senses.\n
...That life.\nI thought you had resigned yourself...\n\nIt appears I was mistaken...\n\n\n
＞Ren's body, having regained the ability to move,\n　clutched at his sword without hesitation.\n\n＞That wordless act in itself shot the signal fire\n　for the fight to begin.\n\n
...Here I come!!\n\n\n
……ん ？　……子供、 か。\n\n\n
……こんなところをウロチョロするな。\n何かあっても知らんぞ。\n\n
いや、 今日はちょっと用があって\n来たんだけど……\n\n
用 ？　このワシにか ？\n\n\n
あぁ、 あんた<C03>ボルドー<C04>っていう\n剣士を知ってるだろ ？\n\n
ボルドー ？\nあのヒヨッコ剣士のことか。\n\n
ヒヨッコ ？\n\n\n
あぁ。　何度打ち負かしても\nめげずに挑戦してくるバカな男だ。\n\n
ヤツはまだまだ剣筋が安定していない。\nだからヒヨッコ、 だ。\n\n
だが、 ……見込みはある。\n\n\n
人間でいうとそれなりに歳をくっておるだろうが、\nあいつはこれからもっと伸びるだろうな。\n\n
で、 そのボルドーがどうした ？\n\n\n
あ、 あぁ、 なんでもあんたと\n再戦の約束をしたとかで、\n\n
その日時が決まったから\n伝えに来たんだ。\n\n
ほぉ。　それは楽しみだ。\n\n\n
こんなところにいると、\n楽しみなんてものは少ないからな。\n\n
何度負けても向かってくるあいつはバカだ。\nだが、 ああいうバカは嫌いじゃない。\n\n
待っていると、 伝えておいてくれ。\n\n\n
あぁ、 わかった。\n\n\n
それじゃ、 俺はもう行くよ。\n\n\n
ちょっと待て。\n\n\n
ん ？\n\n\n
見たところ、 おぬしも剣をかじっているようだな。\nどうだ ？　何だったら稽古を付けてやるぞ。\n\n
げ……どっかの団長みたいな事言うなよ。\n\n\n
と、 とにかく俺の用事は終わったから、\nもう戻るよ ！\n\n
じゃあな。\n\n\n
……やつもなかなか見込みが\nありそうだな。\n\n
Phew...\n\n\n
＞Having finished his first quest, Ren looked\n　at the rewards he'd earnt with a satisfied\n　smile.\n
＞Charnet approached him from behind the counter.\n\n\n
Good work.\nSo, now do you understand how things run from\naccepting a request to completing it?\n
As for what's next, you could continue doing\nquests, or, you could just do your own thing\nin the ruins. You're free to do as you like!\n
And, now that I've tested your skills, I'll\nleave this key for the ruins in your care.\n\n
If you can't get any further without this key,\nVeres won't be able to investigate...\n\n
Don't worry.\nI gave one to your friend earlier.\n\n
You just missed each other.\n\n\n
I see.\n\n\n
He said he had something else to look into,\nbut I wonder what it was...\n\n
Oh, one more thing. I spoke to the <C03>Blacksmith<C04> and\nthe <C03>Item Shop<C04> that we have here in Liruka Village,\nso you should pop round to see them.\n
You'll be needing their help for the road ahead,\nand you might be able to ask them for some advice\nabout your search too.\n
The Blacksmith and Item Shop, huh...?\nAlright. I'll pay them a visit later.\n\n
Well, good luck with your investigation.\nI'll be cheering you on from behind.\n\n
＞And with that, Charnet went back to the\n　other person she was helping.\n\n
＞Ren looked at his rewards again.\n\n
...This isn't so bad, I guess.\n\n\n
＞The treasure slumbering in the ancient ruins...\n　The band of monsters ready to attack...\n\n
＞It was so faint that the person himself didn't\n　even notice his heart quietly throbbing...\n\n
......\n\n\n
Strange... There's a fire here.\n\n\nDid someone abandon their bonfire...?\n\n\n
＞Having found a blazing fire, Ren slowly drew\n　closer to warm his cold body.\n\n
It's unexpectedly cold in these ruins...\nThis thing's a lifesaver.\n\n
＞Holding both hands out to the crackling fire,\n　he surrendered his body to the warmth.\n\n＞.........\n\n\n
...Umm...\n\n\n
...\n\n\n
Hello, good sir?\n\n\n
Mm... Maybe I'm imagining things?\n\n\n
No, it is no such thing.\n\n\n
Yeah, just my imagination...\n\n\n
--W-wait?! Who's there!?\n\n\n
I am right here.\n\n\n
W-where!? Show yourself!!\n\n\n
As I said, I'm right here, in front of you.\n\n\n
In front of me...? It can't be, this fire--!?\n\n\n
Indeed～ You finally realised?\n\n\n
No, well... All the other fireball monsters are\nalways moving around, but you didn't move at all...\n\n
Haha, I see～ Lately, I haven't been feeling too\nwell, so I decided to rest here.\n\n
I suppose my actions really have been out of\ncharacter for one such as myself.\n\n
Out of character...?\n\n\n
Were you the one who helped an archaeologist\ncalled <C03>Mizuka<C04>?\n\n
Mizuka... I don't know anyone by that name,\nalthough...\n\n
Not long ago, there was an incident where I guided\na lost woman to the exit...?\n\n
That's the one. So it was you.\n\n\n
But, why would guiding someone to the exit make\nyou get sick?\n\n
Well... It is embarrassing to admit this, but...\n\n\n
We, light-emitting beings are vulnerable to sunlight.\n\n\n
It seems I was exposed to light, be it a small\namount, as I went near the vicinity of the exit.\n\n
Ever since then, I have been resting here...\n\n\n
...I see.\n\n\n
Well, thanks to you, it seems that I will be able\nto move again soon.\n\n
...Can I ask you something?\n\n\n
By all means.\n\n\n
Why did you go out of your way to show Mizuka\nto the exit, knowing that you are vulnerable to\nlight?\n
...I could never abandon a woman in need.\n\n\n
I am a gentlemen, after all.\n\n\n
...That so?\n\n\n
Well, anyway.\nI've a message she asked me to pass on.\n\n
“Thank you."\n\n\n
I only did what was right.\nI need no thanks.\n\n
Well, it's about time that I was off.\nDo take care.\n\n
...He was a pretty cool guy... for a fireball.\n\n\n
でも、 この石があれば、 俺はお前を\n超越した力を手に入れることが出来る…… ！\n\n
再び、 俺が注目を浴びる日が来る ！\n\n\n
そんなことの為に……\n\n\n
それだけじゃない。\n\n\n
お前と城の警備をしていたとき……\n初めてエルザと出会ったときから、\n俺は、 エルザに惚れていた。\n
……公女様と、 一介の騎士だ。\n釣り合わないのはわかってる。\n\n
……でも、本気だった。\n\n\n
だけど、 いつだってエルザの眼に映っていたのは\n……お前だったんだ。\n\n
…………\n\n\n
俺は、 お前を殺し、 エルザを手に入れ、\n……この世ヲ支配すル。\n\n
世界を、 支配…… ？\nどこまで飛び抜けてやがるんだ……\n\n
コノ世ヲ支配…スル……\nコノヨヲ……\n\n
お、 おい……ヴェルス ！ ？\n\n\n
ウォォォォォォォォォォォォォ ！ ！ ！ ！ ！ ！\n\n\n
ゴォォォォォォォォォォ……\n\n\n
ヴェ、 ルス……お前……\n\n\n
ゴォォォォォォォォォォ ！ ！\n\n\n
こいつ……完全に、 力に飲み込まれたな……\n\n\n
……このままヴェルスを放置したら、\n古代文明の二の舞だ……\n\n
…………\n\n\n
……エルザ……俺がオマエを守る……\n必ず、守ってみせる ！ ！\n\n
＞レンは、 携えた剣をしっかりと握り締め、\n　今、 友を討つ決意を固めた……\n\n
これが…… <[>魔晶石<]> か。\n\n\n
この石さえあれば、 俺も力を手に出来る。\nあいつにも負けない、 力を……\n\n
ヴェルス ！ ！\n\n\n
……さすがだよ、 レン。\n負けるわけはないと思っていたが、\n……本当にお前には驚かされる。\n
ヴェルス、 お前どういうつもりだ ？\n\n\n
俺たちはその石を大公の元に持ち帰る任務を受けて、\nここに来たんじゃなかったのか ？ ！\n\n
お前にだって、 わかるだろ ？\n……あの男がこの石の力を手に入れれば、\nきっと良からぬ事に利用する。\n
…………\n\n\n
軍事利用だとか、 世界を掌握するだとか……\nそんなくだらない事に力を使うくらいなら、\n……俺が使ってやるよ。\n
……何を ！ ？\n\n\n
＞ヴェルスは巨大な <[>魔晶石<]> に\n　その身をあずけるようにして、\n　両手を広げ、 寄り添った。\n
＞すると、 ヴェルスの身体から、\n　青白い輝きが漏れ始める……\n\n
よせ ！　ヴェルス ！\nあの巨大な怪物を見ただろ ！ ？\nお前もあんな姿になりたいのか ！ ？\n
うぉぉぉぉぉぉぉ ！ ！ ！ ！ ！ ！\n\n\n
ヴェルス ！ ！ ！ ！\n\n\n
…………\n\n\n
お、 お前……\n\n\n
大丈夫だよ、 レン。\n俺は何も変わっちゃいない。\n\n
……ただ、 俺は力を手に入れた。\nもうお前には負けない。\n\n
剣の技術も、 エルザのことも……\n\n\n
エルザ ？\n\n\n
……おい、 ヴェルス。\nお前……何を考えてるんだ…… ？\n\n
ここを俺たちの城にする。\nとりあえずは、 そこからだ……\n\n
＞それだけ言うと、 ヴェルスはその場から\n　消えてしまった。\n\n
＞残されたレンは、 既にヴェルスが\n　石の力に捕らわれてしまっていることを\n　確信していた。\n
……エルザが、 危ない。\n\n\n
＞ヴェルスが行おうとしていることが何なのか……\n　今のレンにはわからなかった。\n\n
＞それでも、 エルザの身に危険が\n　迫っていることだけは察知していた。\n\n
Well, speaking of... About the nation of Reville in\nthat book I showed you before...\n\n
Apparently, they're the ones who used alchemy to\ncreate Magicite in the days of Edenbar, which was\ndestroyed a thousand years ago.\n
Using alchemy... to make Magicite?\n\n\n
...It's getting more and more unbelievable.\nAlchemy is the stuff of fiction, right?\n\n
But, the stone really exists.\n\n\n
...To create a miraculous stone, you need a\nmiraculous power.\n\n
There's a lot we don't know, but now you've gotta\nbelieve at least that much, right?\n\n
...I guess so.\n\n\n
So, it's said that ancient civilization's collapse\nwas due to their over-reliance on the power of\nMagicite...\n
Meaning, the “sin committed by the nation of\nReville” mentioned in that book is that they\ncreated the Magicite.\n
...That makes sense.\nDoes that mean this stone is that dangerous?\n
Well, it's hard to say much without seeing the real\nthing, plus, it was an order from the Archduke.\n\n
It doesn't make a difference whatever we think\nhere.\n\n
...\n\n\n
Besides, if things go well...\n...This could be a great opportunity.\n\n
Hm? Did you say something?\n\n\n
N-no, nothing.\n\n\n
I'll try to find out more about it for now, so\ngood luck with everything on your end.\n\n
H-hey! Wait a sec--\n...He never listens to a word anyone else has to\nsay, that guy.\n
＞Veres left quickly, before he’d even had the\n　chance to hear Ren calling.\n\n
...\n\n\n
The Magicite was created by the nation of Reville,\nhuh...?\n\n
...\n\n\n
What..?\nMy right hand feels... off...\n\n
＞Suddenly feeling something strange in his right\n　hand, Ren subconsciously drew his sword.\n\n
Somehow, I feel like I'm overflowing with more power\nthan usual...\n...What is this?\n
＞Ren couldn't hide his bewilderment at the power\n　overflowing from his right hand.\n\n
＞It crossed his mind that until just then, he had\n　been holding the fragment of Magicite in that\n　same  hand.\n
＞If this is the power of that stone...\n\n\n
＞Had Veres not noticed it... or...?\n\n\n
＞Whilst running that question through his mind\n　without solution, something suddenly appeared\n　from beneath the ground.\n
Gaaaoorr----!!!\n\n\n
I-it's huge!?\nThis thing was in the sand--!?\n\n
...Damn.\nAnything really is possible in this place.\n\n
Gaaaoorr----!!!\n\n\n
...I've got no choice, huh?\n\n\n
＞Determined, Ren gripped the sword tightly in his\n　hand and pointed it at the giant sand snake.\n\n
＞Ren signed the request and place it next to\n　Charnet, who was busy seeing to someone else.\n\n
＞Then, with perfect timing, the other visitor\n　left, and Charnet returned to check over\n　the piece of paper.\n
Perfect.　Looks like that didn't give you any\ntrouble.\n\n
Now, all you have to do is fulfil the conditions,\nand then come back here.\nPiece of cake, right?\n
Complete the request, <C03>return to the guild, and\nreport my results<C04>...\n\n
I figured as much.\n...Don't treat me like a kid.\n
Oh?　Did I hit a nerve?\n\n\n
…………\n\n\n
Hehehe.　Sorry, sorry.\n\n\n
Ah, right.　Almost forget!\nThis is for you, since you're new here.\n\n
It's a map of the ruins.\n...Well, it's actually just a piece of paper and a\npen.\n
Anyway, as you walk around the ruins, you can\nfinish it yourself.\n\n
And, there's also a guide published by the guild\naimed at helping new treasure hunters get started.\n\n
You've got to look out for yourself.\nMake sure you have a read through it so you\ndon't end up crying and regretting it later.\n
<C05>    　 【Map of the Ruins】<C04>\n\n When you're inside the ruins,\n a map will be displayed on the\n lower screen.\n <C03>The map will automatically\n update whenever you enter a\n new room.<C04>\n Try walking through every nook and\n cranny to complete it.
<C05>     【Exploration Guide】<C04>\n\n It contains various bits of\n useful info. You can check\n the contents at any time by\n pressing the START button to\n call the <C03>menu, and then going\n to your “Items” and choosing\n the “Key” category.<C04>
A guide to exploring... hm.\n\n\n
As with anything, you need to have a firm grasp\nof the basics, right?\n\n
Especially when it comes to suspicious men who\nlook more like kids, wouldn't-you-say?\n\n
......\n\n\n
Well then, time for you head off to the ruins and\ncomplete that request.\n\n
Yeah, I'll have it done in no time.\n\n\n
＞Peeling himself away from the counter, Ren\n　waved to Charnet and quickly made his way\n　out of the Guild.\n
Let’s see... Hmmm...\nAhh... Interesting...\n\n
What is it?\n\n\n
This book appears to date back to the ancient\ncivilisation. It seems to be about a <C03>permanent skill<C04>\nwhich allows you to perform <C03>Evasive Manoeuvres<C04>.\n
<C03>Evasive Manoeuvres<C04>?\n\n\n
Yes... To summarise it...\n\n\n
“...By curling your body into a small ball and\nrolling quickly, you'll be able to pass through\nnarrow paths with ease...\n
It can also help you to avoid enemy attacks..."\n\n
It sounds kinda weird...\n\n\n
But, if you come across somewhere where it's\ntoo narrow to walk through, or think an enemy\nis about to strike...\n
...Then it might be worth giving this <C03>evasive\nmanoeuvre<C04> thing a shot, right?\n\n
Yeah, no harm in trying.\n\n\n
<C05>　　　　　INFORMATION<C04>\n\n<C03>　【Permanent Skills】<C04>\n　These begin to take effect\n　as soon as they're learnt.\n\n<C03>　【Assigned Skills】<C04>\n　Once learnt, the skill must\n　be allocated to take effect.\n　(SP is required)
<C05>　　　　　INFORMATION<C04>\n\n　You can visit “Skills” from\n　the menu to <C03>view permanent\n　skills<C04> and <C03>assign assigned\n　skills<C04>.\n\n　It's worth checking whenever\n　you learn a new skill.\n
Just like this, if you bring a book that contains\ninformation about a skill to the guild, I'll teach\nyou about it.\n
Only then will you be able to learn the skill.\n\n\n
So... in order to learn a skill, I have to <C03>bring\nthe skill book back with me from the ruins, and\ntake it here, to the guild<C04>.\n
Exactly.\n\n\n
Just remember that once you've found a book, it\nwon't be effective immediately.\n\n
Got it.\n\n\n
Still... having to go all the way back to the exit\nevery time I find a book is such a pain...\n\n
I wouldn't worry about that.\n\n\n
You might already know this, but there's a tool\nthat allows you to instantly travel from the ruins\nback to the village that you could use.\n
Since I have one spare, I'll let you have it.\nCall it a special service for newcomers.\n\n
If you need more, you can buy them at the Item\nShop...\n\n
...or, if you've got all the materials, you can make\none by mixing them together.\n\n
If I'm not mistaken, the recipe is <C03>Fascina Powder<C04>\nand... what was that other one again?\n\n
Well anyways, I think you probably still have some\nways go before you'll be ready to make that...\n\n
So for now, you'll have to buy them whilst you\nfocus on learning the basics and collecting\nmaterials.\n
Right. Thanks for your help.\n\n\n
Oh, no need to thank me.\n\n\n
...Just be sure to see to the guild's request\nlist, okay?\n\n
...Was that your motive all along?\n\n\n
Hehehe. I’m kidding.\nWell, more like half-kidding.\n\n
Now then...\nWas there something else you wanted?\n\n
...\n\n\n
...How to draw out the power... to that...\nNo... But...\n\n
Veres?\nWhat are you doing here?\n\n
...Being overwhelmed by that power...\nMaybe I'm overthinking it... But, in the process...\n\n
...\n\n\n
...Oi!\n\n\n
Wah!?\n--Ren!? When did you get here!?\n\n
...I've been here the whole time.\n\n\n
Popping up without a sound...\nYou're like a ghost.\n\n
...Isn't it just you who was too busy being spaced\nout?\n\n
W-well anyway, perfect timing!\n\n\n
I was actually just thinking of giving this to you.\n\n
A key for the ruins?\nWhy are you giving it to me?\n\n
There's something I want to check up, so I'm\nheading back to the castle for a bit.\n\n
That's why I thought you could use the key to do\na bit of investigating ahead of me.\n\n
...That's unusual.\n\n\n
What is?\n\n\n
Normally, you'd say something about being the\nfirst one there and keep the key with you.\n\n
...I-is that right?\n\n\n
Yeah.\n\n\n
...W-well I guess I've done a bit of growing up too.\n\n\n
Right, I'm off to the castle now, so...\nI'll leave that key to you.\n\n
Wait!\nI haven’t finished talking with you--!\n\n
...What's so important that he's got to rush\nover there for?\n\n
...Still, I got a key that I can use in the ruins,\nso I guess all’s well.\n\n
<C05>　　　　　 INFORMATION<C04>\n\n 【Rutila Key】<C04> obtained.\n\n Now you can advance past <C03>the\n door<C04> that was locked...\n\n You know, the one with green\n walls where a monster holding a\n club lies in ambush. That room.
Somehow... the air in here feels different to the\nprevious rooms...\n\n
＞Ren, having made it deep into the first layer,\n　felt a sense of unease at the strange\n　atmosphere that had settled in the room.\n
＞At that moment, footsteps could be heard coming\n　from one of the corners, and Ren put his guard\n　up.\n
...!\n\n\n
Yo.\n\n\n
Veres? ...Don't scare me like that.\n\n\n
Oops～ Sorry, my bad.\nBy the way, is your search going well?\n\n
I haven't made that much progress.\n\n\n
How about you?\nThat other thing you were on about...\n\n
Huh? ...Oh, that thing.\nWell, I'm getting there, inch by inch.\n\n
But never mind that, I found something interesting.\nHave a read of this.\n\n
＞Veres took out an old book and handed it to Ren.\n\n\n
...It's so dirty that it's hard to read.\nLet's see...\n\n
“We have committed a terrible sin...\nThis stone is something that shouldn't exist...\n\n
Some people worship our nation of Reville as\nGods... but that is a mistake.\n\n
No matter how superior our skills, we are still\nonly human.\n\n
...No, we are less.\n\n\n
We tread foot into a realm that should never\nbe touched by humans...”\n\n
＞Ren read aloud the page that Veres had shown\n　him.\n\n
It seems like it's a record from ancient times,\nbut...\n\n
I got the impression this ‘Nation of Reville' it\nmentions must have been heavily intertwined\nwith these ruins.\n
The ‘Nation of Reville', huh?\n...That's the first I've heard of them.\n\n
Well, I've got this part covered so you should get\nback to searching for the Magicite.\n\n
I'm counting on you!\n\n\n
H-hey! Veres!\n\n\n
＞Without regard to the voice calling out to him,\n　Veres disappeared into another room.\n\n
.........\n\n\n
...That book certainly got my attention.\n\n\n
‘The Nation of Reville...’\nPeople worshiped them like Gods, but they had\ncommitted a huge sin...\n
...That alone has lost me.\n\n\n
＞Ren, trying to wrap his head around the content\n　of the passage he just read was unaware that\n　he was making a big mistake...\n
＞...having forgotten the eerie atmosphere he'd\n　first felt when entering the room, before Veres\n　had interrupted.\n
＞That’s when...\n\n\n
Grrrrrr...\n\n\n
What the-- That thing is...\n\n\n
＞Right in front of him was a ginormous beast\n　with three heads.\n\n
＞It's hostility was plain for all to see.\n\n\n
I've never seen a creature like this before...\n\n\n
Is this another effect of the mysterious stone\nknown as ‘Magicite'?\n\n
Grrrrrr...\n\n\n
...This is no time be lost in thought!\nI've gotta do something that thing first...!\n\n
＞Ren shook his head and gripped at the sword\n　at his waist...\n\n
...Phew.\n\n\n
I wonder if that's the first layer pretty much\ninvestigated now.\n\n
Oi! You there!\n\n\n
...What?\n\n\n
Yo. Is the search going well?\n\n\n
Ah, the blacksmith...\n\n\n
Um... what was it again?\n\n\n
Lagnus!!\n\n\n
Sheesh... And to think I came all this way cuz I\nhave some info for you...\n\n
...Maybe I'll just leave.\n\n\n
S-sorry. I was just kidding.\n\n\n
So... Mr Lagnus.\nWhat was the info you had for me?\n\n
Have you been having trouble gathering material?\n\n\n
...It's hard to be efficient, I guess.\n\n\n
Ain’t it just?\n\n\n
Still, the grass might be the same, but did you\nknow you can pick up different items depending on\nwhere it is? ...The same goes for monsters too.\n
There are materials that can and cannot be\ncollected from monsters with the exact same name.\n\n
...In general, the higher quality materials needed\nto make stronger weapons are in the possession\nof the monsters further inside the ruins.\n
So if you want a certain material, but can't seem\nget it no matter how many you kill...\n\n
...then check to see if there any similar monsters\nelsewhere.\n\n
...That makes sense.\n\n\n
And, I have this for you.\n\n\n
Is this a key for the ruins? Why are you giving it\nto me?\n\n
A customer asked me to go to the ruins to collect\nsome material for making a sword...\n\n
...and I just happened to find it then.\n\n\n
I'm not all that interested in the depths of the\nruins, plus I have no time to go and see them.\n\nThat's why I thought I'd give it to you.\n
...I think it's better that it's used for research\nrather than going to someone who just wants to\ntry dig up treasure.\n
Wow... You really are a good guy.\n\n\n
I thought I already told you to call me ‘Mr Lagnus’!\n\n\n
Thank you... Mr Lagnus.\n\n\n
Much better!\n\n\n
Well, I'm gonna get back.\nIf you find yourself wanting a weapon, pop round!\n\n
<C05>　　　　　INFORMATION<C04>\n\n <C03>【Sapphyri Key】<C04> obtained.\n\n Now you can advance past <C03>the\n door<C04> that was locked...\n\n Eh? You’ve forgotten about it?\n ...Come on now, the door's in\n that looong room. Remember?
……よう。　遅かったな。\n\n\n
…… ？\n\n\n
＞そこは、 これまでの部屋とは異なり、\n　まるで異世界にでも迷い込んだかのように\n　感じるほど、 異様な空間であった。\n
＞そんな部屋の中央にたたずむヴェルス。\n\n\n
＞彼の内側から発せられた、 不自然なほどの\n　異質な雰囲気に飲まれまいとして、\n　レンは、 咄嗟に剣を構えていた……\n
……なんだよ。\n何で俺に剣を向けるんだ ？\n\n
お前……本当にヴェルスか ？\n\n\n
ククク……\n可笑しな事を言うようになったな。\n\n
どこからどう見ても、 俺だろ ？\n\n\n
＞確かに容姿はヴェルスそのものであったが、\n　内側から溢れ出る異質な気配の影響か、\n　レンの目には別人のように映っていた。\n
＞そのヴェルスの手には、 しっかりと\n　<[>魔晶石<]> のカケラが握られている……\n\n
ヴェルス ！　その石をすぐに捨てろ ！\nその石は…… ！\n\n
黙れ。\n\n\n
……石がさぁ……語りかけてくるんだよ……\n力を……力をくれてやる、 って……\n\n
これが、 俺の求めていたものだ……\n……誰にも邪魔はさせない。\n\n
ヴェルス……お前……\n\n\n
レン、 お前もここに来るまでに\n調べたかもしれないが……\n\n
<[>魔晶石<]> には、 それ自身の力を使うこと以外にも、\nその力を引き出す使い方がある。\n\n
…………\n\n\n
……それは、 人間の体内に石の力を埋め込むこと。\n\n\n
石を埋め込まれた人間は、 神をも超越した力を\n手にすることが出来る ！\n\n
だが……その力を制御出来ず、 完全に\nのみ込まれてしまうと、\n見るも無惨な怪物と化してしまう……\n
ちなみに、 古代文明が崩壊した本当の理由は、\nその怪物…… <[>古の巨人<]> が、 文明の全てを\n破壊したから、 だそうだ。\n
…… ！ ？\n\n\n
だが、 馬鹿げたことに、 <[>古の巨人<]> が滅ぼした\n世界そのものが、 自身の原動力である <[>魔晶石<]> の\n力の源でもあった。\n
自らその根源を断ってしまったことで、\n巨人は、 永き眠りにつくこととなる。\n\n
その後、 何とか生き残った <[>レヴィールの民<]> が、\n<[>魔晶石<]> と巨人を、 地下深く封印した……\n\n
それが、 この遺跡なのか ！ ？\n\n\n
ご名答。\n\n\n
さて……俺はそろそろ行かなきゃならない。\n今はまだ、 お前の相手をしている場合じゃないんだ。\n\n
悪いが、 こいつと遊んでいてくれ。\n\n\n
＞そう言うとヴェルスは、 片手に持った\n　<[>魔晶石<]> のカケラを、 地中深く投げ入れた。\n\n
……俺なら、 ダメだったんだろうな。\nでも……お前なら何とかなるんだろ ？\nなぁ……レン……\n
＞部屋を後にしたヴェルスの眼は、\n　どこか寂しさに満ちていた……\n\n
＞レンは、 すぐに後を追おうとしたが、\n　<[>魔晶石<]> のカケラが投げ入れられた場所から\n　突然、 唸り声が聞こえ、 その足を止める。\n
……まさか。\n\n\n
ゴォォォォォォォォォォ……\n\n\n
あいつ、 <[>魔晶石<]> のカケラを使って、\n<[>古の巨人<]> を呼び起こしたのか…… ！ ？\n\n
くそっ。　これ以上おかしな事をする前に、\n何とかヴェルスのやつを止めないと……\n\n
……その前に、 コレをどうにかしないとな。\n\n\n
＞千年の眠りから解き放たれた <[>古の巨人<]> は\n　状況を把握しようとしているのかのように\n　ゆっくり周囲を見渡している。\n
…………\n\n\n
お前なら何とかなるんだろ……か。\n……あぁ。　何とかしてやるさ。\n\n
＞レンは覚悟を決め、 己の何倍もの巨体を\n　強く睨み付ける。\n\n
こいよ、 化け物。\n俺が、 遊んでやる……\n\n
＞その言葉への返事の代わりか、 レンの姿を\n　認識した巨人は、 巨大な両手を振り上げた……\n\n
お前たちに……謝らなくちゃって……\n\n\n
さっき、 レンに言ったことは、\n全部俺が心に仕舞い込んでた事なんだと思う……\n\n
……ずっと……ずっと言いたくて、\n言えなかった、 もう一人の俺の姿……\n\n
エルザに焦がれ……\nレンを憎む……もう一人の、 俺……\n\n
……いや、 憎んでなんかいない。\nただ……\n\n
俺は、 羨ましかったんだ……\nお前の事が……\n\n
…………\n\n\n
でも、 それだけが……本心じゃ、 ない……\n\n\n
……確かに、 レンの存在が、 俺にとって\nコンプレックスだった……\n\n
だけど……それでも……\nガキの頃から剣ばかり握ってきた俺に、\n初めて出来た友達、 なんだ……\n
…… <[>魔晶石<]> の力を使えば、\n少しでもお前を見返してやれるって……、\n力を付けて、 驚かしてやろうって……\n
それが……どんどん、 こんなことになって……\n自分でも……歯止めがきかなくなって……\n\n
……レン……ごめんな……\n\n\n
……もういい。　それ以上話すな。\n\n\n
…うっ……\nそれ、 と……エルザ……\n\n
…………\n\n\n
制御出来なくなってたとはいえ……\nお前には……本当にすまない事をした……\n\n
……謝ったくらいで、 許されるような事じゃ\nないって、 わかって、 る……それでも……\n\n
ごめん……な……\n\n\n
……うっ…ううっ……\n\n\n
エルザ……すまない……\n\n\n
どうして…… ？　どうしてレンが謝るの ！ ？\n\n\n
俺にも、 責任がないわけじゃない。\nあいつは、 俺の友達だから……\n\n
私にだって……\n私にとっても、 大切な友達だった…… ！\n\n
…………\n\n\n
……俺、 もう一度遺跡を調査して回るよ。\n\n\n
……え ？\n\n\n
こんな石が存在したから、 古代の文明も、\n……ヴェルスも壊れてしまったんだ。\n\n
こんな石があったから…… ！\n\n\n
……レン。\n\n\n
だから、 もう二度と同じ過ちを繰り返さないように、\n他にもこの石が残されていないか、 確認してくる。\n\n
その後は、 世界中に存在している古代遺跡を巡って、\n全ての石を破壊する。\n\n
それが、 いま俺に出来る事……\nやらなきゃならない事だと思うから。\n\n
…………\n\n\n
……私も。　お父様亡き今、 この国を\n引っ張れるのは、 私しかいない。\n\n
こんなところで……\n泣いてなんかいられない。\n\n
あぁ。　……泣き顔なんて、\nエルザには似合わない。\n\n
……そう。　そうよね。\nうん。　もう、 泣かない。\n\n
次、 いつレンに会えるのかわからないけど、\nそれまでに、 国を元通りに……\n\n
ううん。　これまで以上の国にしてみせるから……\nだから……\n\n
きっと、 帰ってきて。\n\n\n
あぁ。　”約束” する。\n必ず、 帰ってくるよ。\n\n
＞On the main street of Liruka Village...\n\n\n
＞Ren opened the door of a flashy-looking shop\n　with the sign ‘Avanc's Item Shop'.\n\n
Welcome.\n\n\n
＞The one who had greeted him was a small\n　beastman.\n\n
＞It looked like he was lounging about on top of\n　the counter, but by sitting there, he was just\n　about able to meet Ren at eye level.\n
Oh my my! I haven't seen your face beforre.\nArrre you new?\n\n
I've just registered with the guild, so I was\ntold to come and say hello...\n\n
Ah! So you're the new registrrree, Ren?\nI hearrrd the news.\n\n
I'm Avanc!\nNice to meet you!\n\n
Ah, likewise.\n\n\n
So, this is the item shop, right?\nIs there anyone else around?\n\n
As you see, Avanc is the only one!\nThis is Avanc's Item Shop!\n\n
Wow... Even though you're so tiny.\n\n\n
My size is irrrelevant!!\n\n\n
Besides, Avanc's shop has a reputation forrr\nhaving a wide range of stock!\n\n
If it's items you're afterrr, we have tools and\nmaterials! If it's equipment, there's swords, knifes\nand accessories!\n
If you have money, you can get whatever you want!\n\n\n
And, do you see the <C03>big pot<C04> over therrre?\n\n\n
A big pot?\n\n\n
Err...\n\n\n
Oh, you mean this?\n\n\n
＞Ren replied, pointing at the pot that was stood\n　next to the counter.\n\n
Yes! That's the one!\n\n\n
That pot is the ‘mixing pot'. Just add materials\nand give it a little stirrr...\n\n
...and they'll be mixed together in the lick of a\npaw, giving you a new item or piece of equipment.\nA truly marrrvelous invention!\n
Wow～ That does sound handy.\n...But I'm a bit scared that you haven't brought\nup anything about a charge to use it.\n
Non, non, non!\nTherrre is nothing to be scared of!\n\n
You can use the pot as much as you want,\nwhenever you want, frrree of charge.\n\n
...Free of charge?\n\n\n
I n   e x c h a n g e--!\n\n\n
You must gather your own materials to use at the\nruins, or buy them from Avanc's storrre! Okay?\n\n
Yeah. I'll take you up on that.\n\n\n
<C05>　　　　　INFORMATION<C04>\n\n You can now buy, sell and\n craft items at Avanc's shop.\n\n <C03>Buy:<C04> Purchase items or\n      equipment.\n <C03>Sell:<C04> Sell your belongings.\n <C03>Craft:<C04>Combine materials/tools\n      to create new items.
Now, now...\n\n\n 
Well, I'll give you this present as a token of\nour frrriendship!\n\n
＞Ren placed the book he received into the\n　“Key” category of his bag.\n\n
It's a handy book with some hints about collecting\nmaterials!\n\n
It's full of really, rrreally handy info, so make\nsure you look through it properly later!\n\n
<C05>　　　　　INFORMATION<C04>\n\n　When you defeat monsters in\n　the ruins, they might drop\n　tools or materials.\n\n　You can figure out what kind\n　of items will be dropped from\n　the monster's appearance and \n　type, so get slaying!
<C05>　　　　　INFORMATION<C04>\n\nYou can also collect materials\nat <C03>Grass<C04>, <C03>Trees<C04>, and <C03>Rocks<C04>.\n・Gather materials by pressing\n　up on the D-Pad when prompted.\n・<C03>There is a limited number of\n　times you can visit each site<C04>.\n　That number is reset when\n　you return to the village.
Alright. I'll take a look.\nThank you.\n\n
No no no no no, it's the least I can do.\n\n\n
I n   e x c h a n g e--!\n\n\n
Since you took the trouble of coming here, you\nshould have a look at my warrres.\n\n
I've assembled all sorrrts of essential items\nfor explorring the ruins!\n\n
Well well well, what would you like?\n\n\n
＞The Adventure's Guild, Liruka Village Branch.\n\n\n＞It seemed to have become a base for those\n　who were exploring the ruins, as it was packed\n　full despite being located in a small village.\n＞With four circular tables and a row counters,\n　the small room was bustling night and day.\n\n＞People laughing and drinking...\n　Those stood around quietly...\n\n＞The adventures were enjoying passing the time,\n　when the groan of the door opening sounded\n　the arrival of new visitors.\n
Oh, welcome.\n\n\n
＞The first person to speak was a beautiful\n　woman, stood over the counter.\n\n
Whooooa!\nThat lady is crazy gorgeous, right...?\n\n
We're after Liruka Village's Guild, is this the right\nplace?\n\n
...Oi, so you're actually starting to ignore me\nnow?\n\n
I haven't seen your faces around here before.\nJudging by those outfits, I'd guess you're from\nthe capital?\n
Yeah. We're here to investigate the ancient ruins,\nby order of the Archduke of Kucellbull.\nI'm Ren, one of the Duchy Knights.\n
Likewise, I'm Veres, a Knight of the Dukedom.\nPleased to make your acquaintance.\n\n
Oh, it's you?\nI'd heard the news, but I wasn't expecting you to\nbe so young.\n
Heh heh.　We get that a lot.\n\n\n
＞Veres ogled her, as if he hadn't already stared\n　hard enough.\n\n
I'm Charnet.　The Adventurer's Guild, Liruka Village\nBranch's receptionist, and Guildmaster.\n\n
Miss Charnet, you say...?\nWhat an elegant name.\n\n
Why, thank you.\n\n\n
...By the way, where are these ancient ruins that\nwere uncovered?\n\n
They were discovered several months ago, in a\nforest to the east of the village, but...\n\n
From the tales I've heard from the treasure\nhunters who went in before, it seems like it's\nquite the dangerous place, you know?\n
Don't worry about that!\nWe might not look the part, but we are knights.\n\n
A fair point.\nWell then, could you write your names on these\npapers?\n
＞As she spoke, Charnet pulled two pieces of\n　paper out of a drawer in the counter, and\n　handed them to the men.\n
...Our names?\n\n\n
Yes.　You don't know? Before you can enter\nhistoric relics, you must register with the\nguild overseeing that jurisdiction.\n
Even though you're here by order of the\nArchduke, there are no exceptions. If you're going\nto enter the ruins, register with the guild.\n
Seriously...\nWe're gonna join the treasure hunters?\n\n
＞Hesitating, Veres gave a backwards glance at\n　Ren, who had already finished writing his name.\n\n
It's fine, so get writing.\n\n\n
Ack! You didn't even give it a second thought,\ndid you!?\nYou sure work fast...\n
＞Names signed, they handed their papers back to\n　Charnet.\n
All present and correct.\nWell then, you're all set to head off to the\nruins, but first...\n
By registering with a guild, you can receive a\nvariety of benefits to help you with your\nadventure. For instance...\n
＞Charnet, producing piles of paperwork out of\n　nowhere, threw them down onto the counter-top\n　with a heavy thud.\n
These are...?\n\n\n
Requests that the guild has received about the\nruins.\n\n
People who have registered with the guild can\naccept these requests by paying a small contract\nfee.\n
If you manage to fulfil the request, you'll be\nrewarded for your work, and may even get some\nnew information about the ruins.\n
It might even lead to developments in your\ninvestigation...\nThis could prove to be key to your mission.\n
Err, no... This and that seem like two different\nthings.\n\n
Well, don't be so hard-nosed, you might as well\ntry accepting one for now. Right?\n\n
＞Ren and Veres glanced back and forth between\n　each other's faces, and the mountains of\n　requests piled in front of them.\n
Ah... Ren, sorry! I just remembered, I was asked\nto see to another matter regarding our search\nof the ruins.\n
...Another matter?　I never heard about this.\n\n\n
It's a really important mission!\nSo, this is where we'll have to part ways.\nI'll leave this place to you.\n
I'm counting on you, buddy!\n\n\n
＞With those parting words, Veres left the guild\n　in a flash.\n\n
＞Left all alone, Charnet stared at Ren with a\n　daring smile.\n\n
＞Ren reluctantly picked up one of the request\n　papers.\n\n
ふぅ……少し疲れたな……\n\n\n
……この辺りでちょっと休憩しようか。\n\n\n
＞遺跡内を歩き続けてきたレンは\n　近くの壁にもたれ掛かり、 腰を下ろそうとした。\n　そのとき……\n
…… ！ ！ ？ ！\n\n\n
…………\n\n\n
＞突然目の前に現れたゴーストを見て、\n　柄にもなく、 いちもくさんに逃げ出しすレン。\n\n＞しかし、 ゴーストが追ってくる気配はない。\n　\n　\n＞不審に思ったレンは、 恐る恐る\n　ゴーストへと近づいた……\n　\n
…………\n\n\n
……………………\n\n\n
………………………………\n\n\n
……逃げないのですか ？\n\n\n
…… ！ ！\n\n\n
あ、 いや、 さっきはいきなり現れたから\nちょっと驚いたけど……\n別に何か仕掛けてくる気配もないし……\n
…………\n\n\n
（あれ……もしかして依頼にあった\nゴーストってこいつのことか…… ？）\n\n
…………\n\n\n
……あ、 あのさ。\n\n\n
……はい ？\n\n\n
えっと……遺跡のすぐ近くにある\nリルカ村って知ってるかな ？\n\n
……えぇ。　存じてますよ。\n\n\n
その村にいる<C03>グランジェ<C04>っていう\nおばあさんが、 夜になると遺跡から\n女性の泣き声が聞こえるって言ってて……\n
……多分、 私のことですね。\n\n\n
あ、 やっぱり。\n\n\n
その人、 あんたのことをずいぶんと\n気に掛けてるみたいで……\n\n
えっと……何か辛いことでもあるのか ？\n\n\n
辛いこと、 ですか……\n\n\n
……そうですね。　辛いこと、 だらけです。\n\n\n
…………\n\n\n
（……くそっ。　空気が重すぎる。\nでも、 これも仕事だ……）\n\n
……あ、 あのさ。\n俺でよければ相談に乗るけど…… ？\n\n
……そう、 だん ？\n\n\n
……あ、 嫌ならいいんだけどさ。\n誰かに話して、 はき出してしまえば、\nちょっとはマシになるんじゃないか ？\n
…………\n\n\n
……では、 お願いしてもいいかしら ？\n\n\n
あぁ、 どうぞ。\n\n\n
私は、 ずっと……ずっとこの遺跡に\n存在し続けています。\n\n
詳しい時間なんて、 もう分かりません。\n\n\n
ただ、 人として生きていた頃、\n私はこの遺跡の建設に携わっていました。\n\n
遺跡の建設……って、 おいおい。\nそれ千年以上前の話じゃねぇか。\n\n
それくらい、 経っているでしょうね。\n\n\n
まぁ、 建設と言っても、\n錬金術という技術で生み出したのですが。\n\n
錬金術……\n\n\n
……レヴィールの民 ？\n\n\n
まぁ ！ ？　我らのことを\nご存じなのですか ！ ？\n\n
……あ、 いや、 名前くらいならね。\n\n\n
ということは、 <[>魔晶石<]> についても\n多少の知識はお有りになるということですね。\n\n
ご存じの通り <[>魔晶石<]> とは、 自然界の力を\n錬金術で内部に閉じこめる事に成功した石です。\n\n
火の力を持った石は、 炎を熾し、\n水の力を持った石は、 冷水を垂れ流す。\n\n
人々の生活に少しでも役立てばと思い、\n我らレヴィールの民は研究の末、\nその石を生み出したのですが……\n
生活に欠かせぬものとなった石は、\nついに、 戦の道具としても使われるように\nなってしまったのです。\n
……結果、 たくさんの人が死にました。\n\n\n
人だけではありません。\n文明そのものも、 滅んでしまったのです。\n\n
その切っ掛けを作ったのは\n我らレヴィールの民。\n\n
そんなつもりはなかった……\nなんて言い訳が通用せぬほど、\nそれは大きな過ちでした。\n
…………\n\n\n
我らは自らの罪の尻ぬぐいをし……\nつまり錬金術により生み出された異界の者達と、\n我らの魂を、 この遺跡に封印したのです。\n
……つまり、 みんなしてこの遺跡内で\n自ら命を絶ったと？\n\n
はい。　そういうことです。\n\n\n
我らは、 成仏して魂が消滅する者……\n自ら生み出した石の力の影響を受け、\n魔物となり遺跡内を徘徊する者……\n
そして、 私のように自我を持ったまま\n自負の念からか、 その場にしがみつき続けて\nいる者とにわかれたのです。\n
……さきほど、 あなたはこの遺跡が誕生してから\n千年の月日が流れた、 と言いましたね ？\n\n
……それほどの月日を乗り越えても、\n未だに後悔が消えません。\n\n
……なぜ、 なぜあんな物を\n生み出してしまったのか……\n\n
創り出した者のせいじゃない。\nそれを使う者が悪い。\n\n
……なんていう慰め方は出来ない。\n\n\n
創り出した者は、 創られた物に対して、\n責任を持たなければならないと思うから。\n\n
でも、 あんたはもう十分過ぎるほどの\n責任を感じてきたんだろ ？\n\n
外の世界では、 何百年も前から\n人類は新たな一歩を踏み出してる。\n\n
あんたらの事なんて、 誰もなんとも\n思っちゃいない。\n\n
……だからのうのうと生きろ、\nってことじゃないけどさ。\n\n
もうちょっとこう、 肩の力を抜いて、 さ。\n……うまく言えないけど。\n\n
……言いたいことは、 わかります。\n\n\n
……あなたは、 やさしいですね。\nこうして話しを聞いて貰うことなんて、\nこの長い月日の中で一度たりともなかった。\n
それだけで、 十分。\n……本当に、 ありがとう。\n\n
いや、 まぁ。\n……別に何もしてないから、\nお礼なんていいけど。\n
いえ。　少しらくになったような気がします。\nあなたのおかげです。\n\n
また、 よろしけばいつでも\nいらしてください。\n\n
今度は、 あなたのお話を聞かせて\nもらいたいです。\n\n
あぁ、 また近くまで来たら寄ってみるよ。\n\n\n
じゃあ、 元気で……\nってか早く成仏しろよ ！\n\n
それはまだまだ先のようです。\n\n\n
……だって、 あなたのような\n素敵な殿方と巡り会えたのですから……\n\n
…………\n\n\n
……ありがとう。\n\n\n
＞Tucked away in a corner of Liruka Village was\n　a small shop.\n\n
＞It is the sole smithery in the village, and\n　various weapons lined the walls to the ceiling.\n\n
＞There, inside the store where the sound of\n　flames and iron being struck echoed all\n　around, Ren was stood stock still.\n
...Umm...\n\n\n
...Heeey!\n\n\n
Excuse meeee--!\n\n\n
Calling out over and over again...\nI'm not deaf, ya know?\n\n
＞The person who finally came out was a young\n　man in work clothes, who appeared to be the\n　owner of the store.\n
Ah?　What, it's just some kid...?\nNot seen you around here before, what're\nyou after?\n
I've just registered with the guild, so I was\ntold to come and say hello...\n\n
Oh?　So you must be Ren.\nI heard the news, but... you really are just a kid.\n\n
Well, not that it matters.\n\n\n
If you're gonna make money, you gotta do your\njob properly no matter who it's for!\nThat's my mantra!\n
...‘It doesn't matter’ he says, then why even\nbring it up?\n\n
Hm?　Did you say something?\n\n\n
No, nothing.\n\n\n
Well, anyways!\nI'm Lagnus. I own the place.\n\n
Should the need arise, you can come here to\n<C03>forge<C04> new weapons to equip, or <C03>enhance<C04> the\nones you already own.\n
Forge and enhance weapons?\n\n\n
Yeah.\nForging is when you make weapons from scratch...\n\n
...and enhancing is when you change a weapon\nthat already exists into a different weapon.\n\n
By the way, both require materials and money.\n\n\n
Of course, the better the weapons, the better\nquality material and the more money you'll need,\nbut...\n
Well, there's the guild round here where you\ncan take jobs, or you can go off and gather\nthem on your own.\n
To forge or strengthen weapons, I'll <C03>need raw\nmaterials and money<C04>... right?\n\n
Oh?　I guess you were paying attention.\n\n\n
<C05>　　　　　INFORMATION<C04>\n\nYou can now forge and enhance\nyour main weapon.\n\n<C03>Forge:<C04>       Combine materials\ntogether to create new weapons.\n<C03>Enhance:<C04>    Strengthen a weapon\nyou already own and change it\ninto something else.
...Wait, you’ve gotta be kidding me.\nIs that small sword all you have?\n\n
Hm?　Ah, yeah it is.\nIt's light and easy to handle. It suits me fine.\n\n
＞As he spoke, Ren showed off the sword he\n　had attached to his waist.\n\n
＞Seeing that, Lagnus the Blacksmith was taken\n　aback and let out a large sigh.\n\n
Oi, oi... That's no good.\n\n\n
Taking it case-by-case and reacting to the\nsituation around you is the best way to fight...\n\n
...I know.　Just gimme a min.\nI'll let you have something good.\n\n
＞That said, Lagus disappeared into the back\n　of the store.\n\n
...What's all that about?\n\n\n
*Fwoo...*\nThey haven't used in a long time so they're\na bit dusty but... there's life in them yet.\n
＞Lagnus had come out from the back holding a\n　sword in each hand.\n\n
Here.\n\n\n
＞He handed the two differently shaped swords\n　to Ren.\n\n
...These are?\n\n\n
For your first visit only!\nIt's a special service. After this, you'll have to\nshow your ‘patronage’, okay?\n
Fyi... The <C03>Foil<C04> is a “Medium Sword”, and the \n<C03>Long Sword<C04> is a “Big Sword”.\n\n
It's not a big deal, but it might be good to think\nof it as ‘practise’ when you use them, at least\nuntil you get used to it.\n
...Speaking of, this is for you too.\n\n
＞Ren placed the book he received into the\n　“Key” category of his item pouch.\n\n
The book has a detailed description of the\ncharacteristics for each main weapon category.\n\n
If you want to know the differences between\nSmall Swords, Medium Swords and Big Swords\nthen you should give it a read.\n
<C05>　　　　　INFORMATION<C04>\n\n\n   The Main Weapons (swords)\n     are divided into three\n   major categories; Small\n    Swords, Medium Swords\n　     and Big Swords.\n\n           
<C05>　　　　　INFORMATION<C04>\n\n【Small Swords】\nThese swords are light and easy\nto handle, allowing you to make\n<C03>consecutive attacks<C04>.\n\nHowever, you can't draw out the\nfull power in a single hit.

Right.　Thank you.\n...You're a surprisingly nice guy.\n\n
That’s ‘Mr Lagnus’ to you!\nSheesh. This is why brats without manners are...\n
Well anyway, for now you can try out the store\nand go check out what we have.\n\n
If you already have materials and money, you\ncan get making new weapons straight away.\n\n
So, what'll it be?\n\n\n
\n　　　Kucellbull Castle    Audience Chamber　 　\n\n
＞By decree of the Archduke Kucellbull, every\n　knight in the Dukedom had arrived in that\n　small, decorative room.\n
＞The room was strangely quiet, as if their\n　nerves had barred the sound.\n\n
＞The knights, sworn to serve their country,\n　couldn't help but feel uneasy about the \n　summons, which they had no right to refuse.\n
＞They were trying to avoid the gaze of...\n\n\n
＞The 8th Archduke of Kucellbull.\n　Estrand Kucellbull.\n\n
＞The Archduke inspected the assembly, and gave\n　a single cough as if to get their attention,\n　before opening his mouth...\n 
As most of you are already aware, ancient ruins\nwere recently discovered in Dorius.\n\n
The ruins are said to date back to the Edenbar\nEmpire, believed to have been destroyed over one\nthousand years ago...\n
The archaeologists sent out to investigate were\n...wiped out.\n\n
＞The abrupt announcement stirred up the room...\n\n\n
＞The voice of a single knight cut through the\n　noise.\n
...What exactly do you mean by ‘wiped out'?\n\n\n
Hrmh. It appears the ruins that were discovered,\nstill aren't dead.\n\n
...Not dead?\n\n\n
Even now, one thousand years since it's\nconstruction, the terrifying traps laid throughout\nthe ruins continue to work. That is to say...\n
Perhaps from the many years of neglect, the\ninterior seems to have turned into a den of\nmonsters.\n
＞The room fell into a clamour for the second\n　time...\n\n
＞The men began to question the Archduke.\n\n\n
So, the reason we were summoned is...?\n\n\n
Although the archaeologists are knowledgeable\nabout the ancient civilization, they have no way\nof fighting back against the monsters.\n
Therefore, I'd like you, the Knights of the Duchy,\nto ride for the ancient ruins, destroy the traps\nand monsters inside, and create a path.\n
I see. As you wish, Your Highness.\n\n\n
Oi oi oi, oi oi oi!\nDid you hear that!?\n\n
...Stop making a scene. Your voice is too loud.\n\n\n
'Course I'm gonna make a scene.\nAn unknown ruin where traps and monsters await...\nAs a man, you can't help but be lured in!\n
Yeah. I guess you're right.\n\n\n
Hah? Your apathy is as plain as ever.\nAren't you excited?\nDoesn't this make your heart start to pound?\n
Don't misunderstand, Veres.\nThis isn't a game.　It's work.\n\n
Psht.　That hard-headedness of yours never\nchanges...\n\n
You there! Pipe down!\n\n\n
Ehe... S-sorry.\n\n\n
*Ahem.*\nThen, we shall inform you once a decision is made\nas to when you will depart.\n
Until then, see to it that you make your\npreparations.\n\n
Yes, sire!\n\n\n
＞With the Archduke's speech over, the knights\n　that had gathered round began to file out of\n　the audience chamber.\n
Veres. We should get going too.\n\n\n
Y-yeah.　...Ancient ruins, huh...?\n\n\n
＞A gleeful smile spread across Veres' face, as\n　if he was having a runaway daydream.\n\n
＞Ronixis, commander of the Duchy Knights,\n　approached the two men, and spoke his mind.\n
Veres, can't you do something about that slovenly\nface of yours?\n\n
Oh, C-Captain!　Forgive me!\n\n\n
....Enough.\nMore importantly, the Archduke wishes to speak.\nThe two of you should stay behind.\n
Huh!?　‘The two of you'... As in, US?\n\n\n
Do you see me talking to anyone else?\n\n\n
For real!?\n\n\n
If it's not about the ruins then... there's\nsomething else?\n\n
I wonder.\nI haven't heard anything.\n\n
Anyway, make sure you show some respect, else\nI'll be the one taking the blame for it!\n\n
Got it.\n\n\n
We know, we know, Captain.\nLet's go, Ren.\n\n
...I'm not feeling reassured.\n\n\n
Oh, you're here?\n\n\n
We heard that you had something to tell us?\n\n\n
Mmm. The truth is, I'd like you to go on ahead\nto the ruins, as an advance party.\n\n
...An advance party?\n\n\n
It's dangerous, there's no telling what might\nhappen if I blindly send men in. I hope to ward off\nthe chance of our forces being annihilated.\n
The two of you are still young, but I have heard\nfrom Ronixis that your strength comes guaranteed.\n\n
Your words are too kind.\n\n\n
You humble yourself.　Will you do it?\n\n\n
Of course, sire.\n\n\n
Excellent. ...There is just one more thing.\n\n\n
What now?\n\n\n
...Are you aware of the stone known as “Magicite”\nsaid to have supported the civilization of\nEdenbar's prosperity from the shadows?\n
＞Even though he was puzzled by the Archduke's\n　sudden question, Ren opened his mouth and\n　quietly started to speak.\n
...A mysterious, sparkling blue crystal imbued with\nthe power of the earth. Whoever possess it will\nobtain powers equal to that of a God...\n
It's a legend that has been passed down for\ngenerations, correct?\n\n
It's true that there are those who will insist\nthat it does not exist, and yet there can be\nno doubt that it was real.\n
What's more, there's a chance that the stone is\nresting within the ancient ruins, still intact.\n\n
So we are...?\n\n\n
As the advance party, the two of you shall creep\ninto the ruins, assess the situation, and ascertain\nwhether or not the “Magicite” exists.\n
And, in the event that you do make a marvellous\ndiscovery, you are to secretly recover it, and\nbring it back to me with the utmost haste.\n
There is no need to let anyone else know about\nthis. Understood?\n\n
...For what purpose would the stone be used?\n\n\n
You need not worry about such things.\nJust focus on completing your mission.\n\n
As you wish, Your Highness.\nAs soon as we find the mysterious stone,\nwe will bring straight back to you.\n
Mmm.　Then, you should head to the ruins without\ndelay. They were discovered in the Lorayne\ndistrict... Close to a small village called Liruka.\n
Start by paying a visit to the guild in Liruka.\n\n\n
If you let them know that you're there to inspect\nthe ruins by royal decree, they will see to your\nneeds.\n
Sire! Then, we shall be on our way.\n\n\n
Hrmh. I hope you will return with good news.\n\n\n
Hey! Did you catch that!?\n\n\n
No duh.　I was stood right next to you.\n\n\n
So, we'll be going to the ruins first.\nThis oughta be fun.\n\n
Perhaps.\n\n\n
Psht.　You really are a dull guy, ya know?\n\n\n
Still... “Magicite”, eh?\nI always thought it was just a myth.\n\n
But... It's still bugging me.\nIf the Archduke gets his hands on some, what\non earth is he planning to do with it?\n
He just told us not to worry.\nWhatever he wants to use it for is none of\nour business.\n
Don't go all apathetic on me now.\nI mean, what if the “Magicite” is--\n\n
If I may...\n\n\n
＞The two men turned around to look at whoever\n　had interrupted them.\n\n
＞Standing there was the eldest daughter of\n　the Archduke, Lady Elza Kucellbull.\n\n
＞Her girlish, pretty face had a slightly solemn\n　expression...\n\n
Elza...?\n\n\n
My my, Lady Elza.\nHow do you do?\n\n
Don't play stupid.\n...I overheard you talking before.\n\n
Before...?\nAh, about us going on ahead to investigate\nthe ruins?\n
Yes, that.\n\n\n
So, you came rushing to congratulate us on\nbeing appointed as the advance party?\n
Well... It was only natural, given our talents,\nonly natural～\n\n
That's not it!　...I'm worried.\n\n\n
Elza?\n\n\n
I have a bad feeling...\nLike, something's going to happen to the two\nof you...\n
......\n\n\n
Anyways!\nPlease rest assured, Lady Elza.\n\n
Once we've finished our mission, we'll be sure\nto come back in one piece.\n\n
...Yes, you're right.\nYeah.　It'll be okay, won't it?\n\n
Ah... I should be getting back soon.\n\n\n
Yeah.　We'd better be going soon too...\n\n\n
Right.\nWell, we'll be off then, Elza.\n\n
Yes... But please, be careful.\n\n\n
Sir Ronixis! Hurry!\n\n\n
L-Lady Elza. Please slow down a little...\n\n
Goodness... You're all over the shop!\n\n\n
Is such behaviour appropriate for the Knight\nCommander?\n\n
Hahaha.\nYou've hit me where it hurts most.\n\n
Still, even though you were finally given permission\nby the Archduke to leave the city...\n\n
Whatever made you want to come all this way to\nsuch an empty village?\n\n
Well, Ren are Veres are in this village right now,\naren't they?\n\n
Wha--\nYou came all this way just to see those two!?\n\n
Yes, that's right.\nEspecially Ren, he never shows his face whenever\nhe comes back to the castle, you know?\n
That's why I thought I'd go to see him.\n\n
...Lady Elza. I have been by your side for a long\ntime now, so I know...\n\n
You have not been able to make any friends your\nown age... That can be lonely, or you may have\nalready had to lock away those feelings.\n
But when I see you with that noble air, befitting\nof a princess, it makes me proud.\n\n
However, since meeting those two, I fear you may\nhave crossed the line of proper conduct...\n\n
...\n\n\n
I know what I've said is rude.\n\n\n
I don't mean to cause offense. It's just, you are\nthis kingdom's princess, and they are but knights.\n\n
Please bear the weight of that in mind so that\nyou do not act irresponsibly.\n\n
...I'm well aware.\n\n\n
Lady Elza...\n\n\n
Ren is always telling me the same thing, and, when\nI'm talking to them, I feel the existence of that\ninvisible wall even stronger...\n
...\n\n\n
But regardless, we did come all this way.\nI am allowed to talk to them, right?\n\n
...You're right.\nRegrettably, it seems I am your only bodyguard,\nand just for today, I shall overlook it.\n
Thank you.\n\n\n
Then, I'll head to the village guild to ask for\nnews of Ren and Veres.\n\n
Lady Elza, please wait here for a while.\n\n\n
Right. I'll leave it to you.\n\n\n
...\n\n\n
So, it really is hopeless...\n\n\n
...I wish I hadn't been born a princess.\n\n\n
...No, no! I can't let myself get depressed.\nSince I've come all this way to see Ren, I must\ngreet him with a cheerful, smiling face.\n
Right! Smile, Elza!\nThere's no use worrying about things that can't\nbe changed.\n
Because I am me, after all.\n\n\n
...\n\n\n
...Ronixis is sure running late.\n\n\n
Kekekeke...\n\n\n
Eek! A m-monster...!?\n\n\n
Kekekeke...\n\n\n
N-no...!\nD-don't come near me...!\n\n
S-someone... save me......\nRen...!!\n\n
Elza!!\n\n\n
R-Ren...!\n\n\n
Are you okay?\n...Wait, what are you even doing here?\n\n
...Ren, thank goodness...\nI... I.......\n\n
Jeez...\nYour habit of getting into trouble hasn't changed.\n\n
Here. Stand up.\n\n\n
...\n\n\n
What's wrong?\n\n\n
...I can't get up.\n\n\n
...Huh?\n\n\n
I don't have the strength...\n\n\n
...*Sigh*.\n\n\n
...Here.\n\n\n
...Eh?\n\n\n
Get on my back.\n\n\n
Is that okay?\n\n\n
I can't exactly leave you here, can I?\n...This is part of my job too.\n
...Thank you.\n...Here goes....\n\n
Ngh. ...You're unexpectedly heav--\n\n\n
Say any more and I'll hit you!\n\n\n
...You already have.\n\n\n
Hehehe...\n\n\n
...What?\n\n\n
Eh, you don't remember?\nThis has happened before, you know?\n\n
Is that right?\n\n\n
It did! Let me think... it was when I was caught in\na fight with some man I didn't know in the castle\ntown, and you came to save me.\n
That time I was asked to escort you shopping,\nhuh...?\n\n
...Come to think of it, you were too faint to stand\nback then as well.\n\n
...T-that's because it was really frightening.\n\n\n
But you said something to me back then...\n\n\n
...“I will protect you.”\n\n\n
With that simple statement, I felt so reassured.\n\n\n
...I said that?\n\n\n
You did.\n\n\n
Well, not that I remember.\n\n\n
Grr～ ...You're just going to play it cool again...?\nYou're always like that.\n\n
Which reminds me... There was something I forgot to\nask you that time.\n\n
Something you wanted to ask?\n\n\n
Yes. ...This is the second time you've come to my\nrescue now, but...\n\n
Why did you help me?\n...Just because it's your job?\n\n
...\n\n\n
Hey... answer me...\n\n\n
Lady Elza!\nI went to speak to the guild but... Wh-- Ren!?\n\n
Oh, Captain.\n\n\n
...You have the worst timing.\n\n\n
Hm? Did you say something?\n\n\n
It was nothing...\n\n\n
So, what are you doing here, and why is Lady Elza\non your back?\n\n
I'm the one who should be asking you what you're\ndoing here.\n\n
But more importantly, Captain, why did you leave\nElza alone whilst you wandered off?\n\n
＞Ren told Ronixis about how Elza had been\n　attacked by a monster.\n
W-what did you say... A monster!?\nL-l-l-l-lady Elza! A-a-are you hurt--!?\n\n
I'm fine. My legs were just paralysed by the\nshock. I'm not injured anywhere.\n\n
I-I am glad to hear that.\n\n\n
Save it.\nYou're the one who brought her here...\n\n
It's just good that I happened to be passing by\nwhen I did...\n\n
Yes... It was most reckless of me.\nI'm sorry, Ren.\n\n
And Lady Elza, please forgive me... \n\n\n
I-I really am fine, so don't look so glum. Okay?\n\n\n
Still... I don't know what you came here for, but\nwouldn't it be better to take Elza home as soon\nas possible?\n
You're right. It will be getting dark soon.\nWe should head back.\n\n
Eh? We're leaving already?\n\n\n
You've only just escaped from danger, you really\nought to take it easy...\n\n
...Alright.\n\n\n
Ren, I'll be waiting for you at the castle, so the\nnext time you're back, you must drop by.\nPromise me!\n
...Lady Elza...\n\n\n
...Ah--\n\n\n
Fine, I've got it, so go home already.\n\n\n
And Captain, you're an old man already, so don't\noverdo it.\n\n
Nck! I'm going to ignore what you just said.\n\n\n
...Honestly! I'm going on ahead.\n\n\n
W-w-wait for me!\n\n\n
...What did those two even come here for?\n\n\n
Phew...\nIt feels like it's been a really long time since I\nlast saw daylight.\n
But, never in my wildest dreams would I have\nguessed there were such beasts with three heads.\n\n
That has to be... the result of the Magicite.\n\n\n
Meaning there's a high chance that the stone is\nresting within the ruins.\n\n
I'm also curious about the ‘Nation of Reville' in\nthe book that Veres found...\n\n
...Guess I should return to Kucellbull Castle and\nreport on what's been going on.\n\n
As for Veres...\n\n\n
...Better to just drop it.\n\n\n
Ren of the Duchy Knights calling.\nI have returned.\n\n
Oh? Welcome back.\n\n\n
And how fares the ruins investigation?\nIs all going well?\n\n
There hasn't been that much progress as of yet,\nbut...\n\n
＞Ren spoke of his encounter with the huge three\n　headed beast, and the effect of the Magicite.\n\n
...I see. It's true that I've only ever heard of\nthree headed beasts and the ilk as the subject\nof fairy tales.\n
Which you mean to say, was the result of the\nMagicite, and given that the giant beast exists,\nthe Magicite must also exist somewhere...?\n
Yes. And, there is one more thing.\n\n\n
Is Your Highness familiar with the nation known\nas ‘Reville'?\n\n
The Nation of Reville? I haven't heard the name...\nAre you saying they have something to do with\nthe Magicite?\n
I'm not sure it they have anything to do with\nthe stone, but...\n\n
Apparently, they're a people with a deep\nconnection to the ancient ruins.\n\n
There was a description to that nature in a\nbook that Veres, who I was sent to investigate\nwith, found in the ruins...\n
Hm. It is certainly curious...\nYou have uncovered more than we expected.\n\n
Further investigation of the ruins should reveal\nmore details about this 'Nation of Reville'.\n\n
Return to the ruins and continue investigating\nat once. Understood?\n\n
Sire!\n\n\n
＞After finishing his report, Ren left the Archduke\n　and made ready to leave for Liruka.\n\n
Right then, suppose I should get going...\n\n\n
Wait, Ren!\n\n\n
You know... If you're back, you should at least\ncome and say hi!\n\n
O-oi... There's no need to be so loud.\n\n\n
Don't forget the difference in our standings.\nEven just talking is...\n\n
That kind of thing doesn't matter.\n\n\n
............\n\n\n
It's not like everyone in the castle doesn't\nalready know that in the first place, right?\n\n
...It just means more trouble for me, though.\n\n\n
Ah. What a horrible thing to say.\n\n\n
It's the truth.\n\n\n
You really have no manners.\n\n\n
...I was worried, you know.\n\n\n
It's work. I don't have much choice.\n\n\n
Heartless as ever, I see.\n\n\n
Well, even if things get a little dangerous, when\nRen and I are together, it's pretty much child's\nplay. Right?\n
Don't lump me together with you.\n\n\n
Honestly, you get carried away so easily...\n...Wait, Veres--!? When did you get here!?\n\n
Heh heh. I thought I should come and show my\nface so I wouldn't worry the Lady Elza.\n\n
...Don't just pop up out of nowhere.\n\n\n
Hah? Did you say something?\n\n\n
No, nothing.\n\n\n
Hehe...\n\n\n
Come to think of it, what was that other matter\nyou had to take care of in the end?\n\n
Other matter? What are you on about?\nDid I say something like that?\n\n
............\n\n\n
Woah～ Ren dear, that's a scary face you're\nmaking. If the wind changes, your face might\nstick like that, y’kno?\n
Why you-- Treating me like I’m some kid...\n\n\n
Hehehe... Ahahahahaha!\n\n\n
Elza?\n\n\n
Did we... break Elza...?\n\n\n
Aaaah～...\nWe haven't had a chance to talk like this with\njust the three of us lately, have we?\n
That's why it just made me happy.\n\n\n
Right? Right?\nAs I thought it's just hopeless when I'm not\naround, right?\n
Yes. And Ren too, of course.\n\n\n
............\n\n\n
...I think it’s always like this with the three of\nus, but...\n\n
...when I think about it, the two of you really\nhaven't changed at all since we first met.\n\n
I just wanted to go for a little stroll around\nthe castle...\n\n
That's not a stroll.\nIt’s called an escape attempt.\n\n
You don't have to spell it out!\n\n\n
Back then, me and Ren were walking around the\ncastle’s courtyard on patrol.\n\n
...Right. And then we saw this shabby-looking girl...\n\n
You could have done without the ‘shabby' part!\n...Well, not that I can deny it.\n\n
So, we never could've guessed that her highness\nwould be looking like that, and we got the wrong\nidea thinking you were up to something fishy.\n
You did!\nThe two of you were being so rude, even I got\na bit worked up and argued.\n
But in the middle of that, Ren wanted to take me\naway and Veres, you insisted on taking me back to\nyour room instead, so the two of you fought...\n
The other knights heard the noise and came\nrushing...\n...and we got into a whole load of trouble.\n
Yeah... I practically had my ears chewed off\nafter that...\nAnd we didn't even do anything wrong...\n
So trying to take Elza to your room was...?\n\n\n
No, that was... Right!\nThat was cuz I wanted to take my time to question\nher about why she was out there and...\n
...Not that it really matters anymore.\n\n\n
That was the first time I'd ever raised my voice\nso much, and also the first time anyone had ever\nbeen so rude to me.\n
...To think that I'd have friends like that, it\njust～～ Just made me kinda happy.\n\n
So much time has passed since then but, here you\nare, quarrelling over something trivial again...\nYou really haven't changed.\n
Haven't changed, huh...?\n\n\n
That's right... Nothing's changed.\nSince then, nothing has...\n\n
Something wrong?\n\n\n
Ah-- No, it's nothing.\n\n\n
Oh? If it isn't Ren and Veres.\n\n\n
Captain! Long time no see.\n\n\n
When did you get back?\n...Wait, now's not the time for all that.\n\n
Lady Elza. The Archduke is calling for you.\nPlease return as soon as possible.\n\n
Father is...?\n\n\n
Yes. Well, I have somewhere else I need to be, so\nLady Elza, if you please...\n\n
...I stayed longer than I meant to myself.\nI should be getting back soon.\n\n
Yes, I had better go too.\n\n\n
Ah, but the next time you're back, you have\nto come and talk with me properly. Alright?\n\n
If I feel like it.\n\n\n
...Honestly!\n\n\n
Then... be safe, both of you.\n\n\n
＞Walking away slowly, as if she didn't want to\n　say goodbye, Elza took her leave.\n　\n
Right, let's go.\n\n\n
Oh, I still have a bit more to do here, so go ahead\nand push on with the search again without me.\n\n
...That other thing of yours, huh?\nCan't you at least tell me what it's about?\n\n
Ah～ ...W-well another time, yeah?\nSee you at the ruins!\n\n
...No matter.\n\n\n
For now, I should focus on my own job and finish\nthe rest of the investigation.\n\n
First off, I guess I should drop by the guild...\n\n\n
…………\n\n\n

＞ヴェルスは一歩、 また一歩と\n　へたり込んだエルザに近づいていく……\n\n
でも、 大丈夫。\nこれからはいつだって俺がキミの傍にいるから。\n\n
だから、 寂しくなんてないよ。\n\n\n
ヴェルス……まさか、 あなたが ！ ？\n\n\n
俺はこの力を持ってシテ……\n新タナル国ヲ創ル……\n\n
う…うぅ……\n\n\n
＞ヴェルスは突然、 頭を抱えもがき始めた。\n\n\n
＞隣にいたエルザは、 いまだ状況を\n　把握しきれないでいる。\n\n
ヴェルス、 どうしたの ！ ？\nあなた……本当にヴェルスなの ！ ？\n\n
……はぁ、 はぁ。\nだ、 大丈夫だよ、 エルザ。　心配ない。\n\n
俺は、 俺だ……こんな石ごときに……\n完全に支配されて、 たまるか…… ！\n\n
石…… ？\n\n\n
＞怪訝な顔で見つめるエルザを、\n　ヴェルスは片手で抱え上げた。\n\n
きゃあぁぁぁ ！\nちょ、 ちょっと、 ヴェルス ！　降ろしなさい ！\n\n
大丈夫……大丈夫だよ……\n\n\n
何が……何が大丈夫なのよ ！\nこんな状況で……お父様……お父様ぁぁ ！ ！\n\n
……ともに行こう。\n俺が築き上げる、 新世界へ。\n\n
＞エルザを担いだヴェルスは、\n　遺跡から移動したときと同じようにして、\n　再び、 その姿を消した……\n
……エルザ、 様。\n\n\n
＞ヴェルスが去ってから、 数時間後……\n　\n　\n
こ、 これは ！ ？\n\n\n
＞美しかったクセルブル城……\n　\n　\n
＞壁は崩れ、 人々は埋もれ……\n　まさに地獄絵図と化したその光景が\n　レンの心に強く突き刺さる。\n
＞変わり果てた世界を前に立ち尽くすだけで\n　動くことすら叶わない……\n　\n
＞すると、 部屋の奥から\n　微かに響く小さな声が聞こえた。\n　\n
……レン……レン、 なの、 か ？\n\n\n
…… ！ ？\n　\n　\n
ロニキス団長 ！ ？\nこれは一体……\n\n
ど、 どうやら……お前は、\n正気を保っているよう、 だな……\n\n
俺は…… ？\n\n\n
まさか、 ヴェルスが ！ ？\n\n\n
……信じられんかも、 しれんが、\n全部、 あいつの仕業、 だ……\n\n
止めようとしたんだがな……\n見事に、 返り討ち、 だ……\n\n
……遺跡で、 何があったのかは知らんが\nあれはもう……私たちの知るヴェルスでは、 ない……\n\n
……いや、 そもそも、 すでに人ですら\nないのかも、 しれん……\n\n
人じゃ、 ない…… ？\n\n\n
い……行け、 レン……\nあいつを、 止めるんだ……\n\n
ロニキス団長……\n\n\n
エルザ……公女が……あぶ、 な……い……\n\n\n
だん、 ちょう…… ？\n\n\n
＞レンの腕の中で、 ロニキスは静かに\n　息を引き取った……\n　\n
＞……レンは、 涙を流さない。\n　今はまだ、 その時でないことを分かっていた。\n　\n
あいつ、 遺跡で “ここを俺たちの城にする”\nって言ってたな……\n\n
……エルザ ！ ！\n\n\n
＞レンは、 再び遺跡を目指し、 城を跡にした。\n　\n　\n
ふぅ……\nさすがに少し、 疲れたな。\n\n
三ツ首の獣に、 巨大な砂蛇……\nそれに、 ドラゴン……\n\n
なんか、 頭がおかしくなりそうだ。\n\n\n
……とりあえず、\n<[>魔晶石<]> のカケラの事もあるし、\n一度、 クセルブル城に戻ろう。\n
＞顔には疲労の色が見え隠れしていたが、\n　それでも足早に、 レンは城へと歩み出した。\n　\n
公国騎士団所属、 レン。\nただいま戻りました。\n\n
おぉ。　レンか。\n\n\n
して、 何か進展はあったのか ？\n\n\n
実は……\n\n\n
＞レンは、 <[>魔晶石<]> を生み出したという\n　<[>レヴィールの民<]> について……\n　\n
＞通常では考えられぬほどに巨大化した砂蛇や、\n　深緑、黄金、真紅のドラゴンについて……\n　\n
＞そして、 遺跡第二層の奥でヴェルスが見せてくれた \n　<[>魔晶石<]> のカケラについて、 大公に報告した。\n　\n
…… <[>魔晶石<]> のカケラ、 か。\n\n\n
しかし、 そのカケラには石本来の効力が無いと、\nそうヴェルスは言っておったのだな ？\n\n
えぇ……\n\n\n
＞レンは、 あえて石に触れたことにより得た\n　変化のことは、 報告しなかった。\n　\n
＞何より、 あの現象が石の力なのかどうか、\n　本人でさえハッキリとしていないのだから……\n　\n
だが主の言うとおり、 カケラが残っているという\nことで、 完全なる <[>魔晶石<]> の存在の可能性が \nますます高くなったということだな。\n
ふむ……良いぞ。\nかの力を我が物に出来る日が近づいておる……\n\n
…… ？\n\n\n
では、 そろそろ遺跡の調査も終盤であろうが、\nこれまで以上に気を引き締め、\n必ず、 <[>魔晶石<]> を見つけるのだ。\n
よいな ？\n\n\n
はっ。\n\n\n
＞一通りの報告を終えたレンは、\n　考え込むような顔で立ち止まる。\n　\n
……別に、 あいつが何をしていようと\n俺には関係ないが、\n\n
大公の命令に反するようなことがあれば、\n力ずくでも止める必要はある、 か……\n\n
＞遺跡でヴェルスの取った行動が、\n　レンの頭の奥に、 微かに引っかかっていた……\n　\n
おぉ。　レンじゃないか。\n\n\n
団長……\n\n\n
お前、 また大公に報告だけして\n向こうに戻るつもりだったんじゃないか？\n\n
そのつもりだが ？\n\n\n
……もう少し他人の考えに興味を持てないのか ？\n\n\n
俺だって、 お前たちのことを\n心配してないわけじゃないんだぞ ？\n\n
どれだけ心配されたところで、\n遺跡に行かなきゃならない事に変わりはない。\n\n
それに、 確かにおかしな場所だけど、\n必要以上に気を張るような任務でもない。\n\n
……そういう問題ではないのだがな。\n\n\n
そういえば、 ヴェルスはどうした ？\n一緒じゃないのか ？\n\n
あいつは、 何か別件があるとかで\n今は別々に調査している。\n\n
別件 ？\n\n\n
聞いてみたが、 はぐらかすばかりで……\n内容はよく分からないが……重要な任務らしい。\n\n
そうか。　なんだか珍しいな。\n\n\n
珍しい？\n\n\n
ともに騎士団へ入団を果たした日から、\nお前たち、 ほとんど一緒にいたじゃないか。\n\n
訓練も、 実戦も、 おまけに部屋も相部屋だしな。\n\n\n
別に望んで一緒にいたわけじゃない。\n\n\n
だが、 楽しくないわけじゃなかっただろう ？\n\n\n
覚えているか ？　お前たちが、 エルザ様を\n不審者呼ばわりした夜のことを……\n\n
あぁ……無実の俺たちを怒鳴ったあと、\nいい歳して一人酒が趣味だとかなんとか、\n哀れな話を聞かせてくれたときのことだろ ？\n
……だいたい当たってるが、\nもう少し上司を敬え。\n\n
あのとき、 約束しただろ ？\nお前たちが一人前になったら、 三人で飲もうと。\n\n
……まだ一人前、 というわけでないが、\nこうして二人、 任務を任されるようにまでなった。\n\n
この一件が片付いたら……\n\n\n
俺は酒は飲まない。\n\n\n
一杯くらい付き合え ！\n\n\n
あのときからお前たちはずっと一緒だったろう ？\n\n\n
そんなお前たちを見てきたからこそ、\n一人で任務を遂行する姿に、\n嬉しかったり、 寂しかったりするわけだよ。\n
……ずいぶんと老けた発言だな。\n\n\n
ははは。　歳はそれほど離れてはいないが、\n感覚的には息子を育てる父親のようなものだからな。\n\n
多少めんどくさくても付き合え。\n俺はお前たちが可愛いんだ。\n\n
ヴェルスに会ったら、 伝えておいてくれよ。\nそれじゃ、 またな。\n\n
……息子、 か。\n\n\n
＞団長と話し終えた後、 レンは城を出るため、\n　出口へと向かって歩き出した。\n　\n
＞すると、 レンの進路を遮るようにして立つ\n　一人の少女の姿が目に入った……\n　\n
…………\n\n\n
……よ、 よぅ。\n\n\n
また……\n\n\n
…… ？\n\n\n
また約束破って出て行く所だったんでしょ ？\n\n\n
あ……いや……\n\n\n
もぅ……本当に私のことなんて\n何も考えてないのね。\n\n
…………\n\n\n
考えているさ。　自国の公女を守るのも、\n騎士の仕事のひとつだ。\n\n
同じように、 今進めている調査も立派な仕事だ。\n大公にも、 急かされているしな。\n\n
はいはい。　そうですね。\n\n\n
…………\n\n\n
……あ、 そういえば、\nヴェルス、 見なかった ？\n\n
ヴェルス ？　いや、 ずっと一人だが ？\n……あいつがどうかしたのか ？\n\n
少し前、 中庭でヴェルスと会ったの。\n\n\n
最初、 何かぶつぶつ独り言を言っているようで……\n私、 話しかけたんだ。\n\n
そしたら……\n何かこう、 いつもと違うというか……\n\n
すごく説明しにくい事なんだけど……\nヴェルスであってヴェルスでない、 みたいな ？\n\n
……意味がわからない。\n\n\n
んー……\nとにかくヴェルスの様子がおかしかったのよ。\n\n
レンなら何か知ってるんじゃないかと\n思ったんだけど……\n\n
あいつはいつだっておかしいだろ。\n\n\n
……ヴェルスが聞いたら泣いちゃうぞ ？\n\n\n
あ、 そうだ。　ねぇ、 ちょっとあっち向いて。\n\n\n
あっち ？\n\n\n
えぇ、 後ろ。　こっちに背中向けて立って。\n\n\n
どうして ？\n\n\n
いいから早く。\n\n\n
これ、 あげるね。\n\n\n
ネックレス…… ？\n\n\n
レンに似合うかなぁって思って。\n\n\n
あ、 あとね、 付けた人の身を守ってくれる\n効果もあるんだって。\n\n
危険な場所に行っているレンにこそ\nぴったりでしょ ？\n\n
だから、 心配しすぎだって……\n\n\n
いいじゃない。\nしすぎたって、 減るものじゃないし。\n\n
そういう問題じゃない。\n\n\n
そういう問題なの。\n\n\n
……ヴェルスのことも気になるし、\nお願い……本当に無茶だけはしないでね。\n\n
…………\n\n\n
……ね ？　……お願い。\n\n\n
……約束は、 出来ない。\n\n\n
どうして ？\n\n\n
俺はこの国に仕えている身だ。\n\n\n
大公の命令であれば、 命を落とすような任務だって\n受けなければならない。\n\n
そういう仕事だ。\n\n\n
だから、 無茶なこともするかもしれないし、\n……帰ってこないかもしれない。\n\n
だいたい、 公女と騎士だ。\n軽々しい約束なんて出来るはずもないし、\n\n
……こっちとしても、 したくない。\n\n\n
…………\n\n\n
……そう、 だよね。\n\n\n
私が公女で、 あなたは騎士。\nそれは変えようがないことだもんね。\n\n
……私、 そろそろ戻らないと。\n\n\n
あぁ……俺も、 もう行くよ。\n\n\n
えぇ。　それじゃ……気をつけて。\n\n\n
……ごめんな。\n\n\n
…………\n\n\n
……さて、 遺跡に戻らないと。\nヴェルスの事も気になるしな……\n\n
エルザには、 はぐらかしておいたけど、\nあいつ、 確かにおかしい。\n\n
……たぶん、 あの石のカケラを手に入れてから。\n\n\n
…………\n\n\n
早めに見つけた方がいいな……\n\n\n
＞レンは、 再びリルカ村を目指し、\n　クセルブル城を後にした。\n　\n
……さて、 と。\n\n\n
もう一度遺跡の中を調査しに行くか。\n\n\n
ちょっと待つデシ～ ！ ！ ！ ！\n\n\n
……なんだ ？\n\n\n
やぁやぁやぁ。\n元気デシか ？\n\n
……アーヴァンク、 か。\n\n\n
どうしたんだ ？　そんなに慌てて。\n\n\n
レンにお届け物デシ ！\nこれを渡しに来たデシ ！\n\n
さぁさぁさぁ ！\n早く受け取るデシ ！\n\n
これは、 遺跡で使える鍵か。\nどうして俺に ？\n\n
知らないデシ。\n\n\n
さっきたまたま出会った栗色で長髪の男の人に、\nレンに出会ったら渡してくれって頼まれたデシ。\n\n
（……栗色の長髪 ？　ヴェルスか ？）\n\n\n
で、 そいつは他に何か言ってなかったか ？\n\n\n
何も言ってなかったデシよ。\n\n\n
……そうか。　わかった、 ありがと。\n\n\n
いーってことデシ。\n\n\n
そ　の　か　わ　り　！\n\n\n
また、 必ずアーヴァンクの道具屋に\n顔を出すデシ ！\n\n
商品そろえて待ってるデシ～ ！\n\n\n
……ヴェルスの考えていることは\nわからないけど、\n\n
この鍵があれば、 遺跡の奥へ\n進めそうだな。\n\n
……さて、 仕事に戻るか。\n\n\n
